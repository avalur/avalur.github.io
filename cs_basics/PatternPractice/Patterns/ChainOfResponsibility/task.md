### **🔗 Chain of Responsibility Pattern Overview**
- **🛠️ Behavioral Design:** Organizes handlers to act in a chain, each handling a part of a request and optionally passing it to the next handler.
- **📦 Decoupling Request Handling:** Enables decoupling of the sender of a request from its receivers by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

### **🏦 Practical Example**
- **📞 Customer Service Call Analogy:** Describes a customer service scenario where requests are passed along a chain of operators, each with specific responsibilities.

### **🔧 Implementation Insights**
- **👥 Handler Classes:** Defines concrete handlers that perform specific actions, linked together to form a chain.
- **🔄 Dynamic Configuration:** Allows dynamic adding, removing, or reordering of handlers, providing flexibility in how requests are processed.

### **⚙️ Advanced Application**
- **🔑 Authentication System:** Uses the pattern in an authentication system to sequentially handle checks like user existence, password validation, and role checks.
