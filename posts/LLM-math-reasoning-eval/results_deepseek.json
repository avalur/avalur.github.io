      "<think>\nI need to solve this problem. Let me understand it first. We have an even positive integer \\(a\\), and I need to find all real numbers \\(x\\) such that for every positive integer \\(b\\), this equation holds:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} \\cdot b^{a-1} \\right\\rfloor = b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nThe left side has a floor function of the product of the \\(a\\)-th root of \\((b^a + x)\\) and \\(b^{a-1}\\). The right side is \\(b^a\\) plus the floor of \\(x/a\\).\n\nSince \\(a\\) is even and positive, and \\(b\\) is any positive integer, I need this to hold for all such \\(b\\). That suggests that \\(x\\) might need to be chosen in a specific way that doesn't depend on \\(b\\), but makes the equation true for every \\(b\\).\n\nI recall that floor functions often involve dealing with fractional parts or inequalities. Let me denote the left side and try to manipulate it.\n\nSet \\( y = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} \\). So, \\( y \\) is the \\(a\\)-th root of \\(b^a + x\\). Then the left side is \\( \\lfloor y \\cdot b^{a-1} \\rfloor \\).\n\nNotice that \\( y^a = b^a + x \\), so \\( x = y^a - b^a \\).\n\nThe right side is \\( b^a + \\lfloor x / a \\rfloor = b^a + \\lfloor (y^a - b^a)/a \\rfloor \\).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\lfloor y \\cdot b^{a-1} \\rfloor = b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{y^a - b^a}{a} \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nNow, \\( y = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} \\). Since \\(x\\) is real, and \\(b^a\\) is integer, \\(y\\) is slightly larger than \\(b\\), because \\(b^a + x > b^a\\) as long as \\(x > 0\\), but \\(x\\) could be negative, but probably \\(x\\) needs to be chosen such that \\(b^a + x > 0\\) for all \\(b\\), which it will be if \\(x\\) is not too negative, but since \\(b\\) can be large, \\(x\\) might need to be positive. The problem doesn't specify, so I should consider \\(x\\) such that for all \\(b\\), \\(b^a + x > 0\\), so \\(x > -b^a\\) for all \\(b\\), which implies \\(x \\geq 0\\)? No, because as \\(b\\) increases, \\(-b^a\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so for fixed \\(x\\), when \\(b\\) is large, it's fine, but for small \\(b\\), it might be negative. Actually, for each fixed \\(x\\), when \\(b\\) is large, \\(b^a + x > 0\\), but for small \\(b\\), if \\(x\\) is very negative, it might be negative, but since \\(a\\) is even, the \\(a\\)-th root is defined only for non-negative numbers, so we must have \\(b^a + x \\geq 0\\) for all positive integers \\(b\\).\n\nThe smallest \\(b\\) is 1, so \\(1^a + x = 1 + x \\geq 0\\), so \\(x \\geq -1\\). For \\(b=1\\), \\(1^a + x = 1 + x \\geq 0\\), and for larger \\(b\\), it's automatically satisfied if \\(x \\geq -1\\). So \\(x \\geq -1\\).\n\nNow, back to \\(y = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x}\\). When \\(x\\) is small, \\(y\\) is close to \\(b\\). Specifically, \\(y > b\\) if \\(x > 0\\), and \\(y < b\\) if \\(x < 0\\), but since \\(a\\) is even, and \\(b^a + x > 0\\), \\(y > 0\\).\n\nActually, \\(y > b\\) iff \\(y^a > b^a\\) iff \\(x > 0\\), and similarly for less than.\n\nSet \\( y = b + \\delta \\), where \\(\\delta\\) is small, but \\(\\delta\\) might not be constant.\n\nSince \\(y\\) is close to \\(b\\), I can write \\( y = b + \\epsilon \\) for some small \\(\\epsilon\\), and expand \\(y^a\\).\n\nRecall the binomial expansion for \\(y^a = (b + \\epsilon)^a = b^a + a b^{a-1} \\epsilon + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\epsilon^2 + \\cdots + \\epsilon^a\\).\n\nBut in this case, \\( y^a = b^a + x \\), so \\( x = y^a - b^a = a b^{a-1} \\epsilon + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\epsilon^2 + \\cdots + \\epsilon^a \\).\n\nThe left side of the equation is \\( \\lfloor y b^{a-1} \\rfloor = \\lfloor (b + \\epsilon) b^{a-1} \\rfloor = \\lfloor b^a + b^{a-1} \\epsilon \\rfloor \\).\n\nSince \\(b^a\\) is integer, this is \\( b^a + \\lfloor b^{a-1} \\epsilon \\rfloor \\), because \\( b^{a-1} \\epsilon \\) might not be integer.\n\nIs that correct? \\( \\lfloor b^a + f \\rfloor = b^a + \\lfloor f \\rfloor \\) for any real f, since \\(b^a\\) integer. Yes.\n\nSo left side is \\( b^a + \\lfloor b^{a-1} \\epsilon \\rfloor \\).\n\nNow the right side is \\( b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor = b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{y^a - b^a}{a} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nBut \\( y^a - b^a = x \\), and from earlier, \\( y^a - b^a = a b^{a-1} \\epsilon + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\epsilon^2 + \\cdots + \\epsilon^a \\).\n\nSo \\( \\frac{y^a - b^a}{a} = b^{a-1} \\epsilon + \\frac{\\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\epsilon^2}{a} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\epsilon^a}{a} \\).\n\nNote that \\( \\frac{\\binom{a}{k}}{a} = \\frac{1}{a} \\binom{a}{k} = \\binom{a-1}{k-1} / k \\), but perhaps it's better to factor out.\n\nSet \\( z = b^{a-1} \\epsilon \\), so z is the main term.\n\nThen \\( x = y^a - b^a = a z + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\epsilon^2 + \\cdots + \\epsilon^a \\).\n\nNow \\( \\epsilon = z / b^{a-1} \\), so the higher order terms are \\( \\binom{a}{k} b^{a-k} \\epsilon^k = \\binom{a}{k} b^{a-k} (z / b^{a-1})^k = \\binom{a}{k} b^{a-k} z^k b^{-k(a-1)} = \\binom{a}{k} z^k b^{a - k - k a + k} = \\binom{a}{k} z^k b^{(a-k) - k(a-1)} \\), this is messy.\n\nExponent of b: a - k - k(a-1) = a - k - k a + k = a(1 - k) - k + k = a(1 - k)? Let's compute:\n\na - k - k(a - 1) = a - k - k a + k = a - k a = a(1 - k).\n\nOh, so \\( \\binom{a}{k} b^{a-k} \\epsilon^k = \\binom{a}{k} b^{a(1 - k)} z^k \\).\n\nSince k \u2265 2, a(1 - k) \u2264 a(-1) = -a < 0, and as b increases, this term goes to 0 if z is bounded, but z might depend on b.\n\nIn terms of z, \\( x = a z + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a(1-2)} z^2 + \\binom{a}{3} b^{a(1-3)} z^3 + \\cdots + \\binom{a}{a} b^{a(1-a)} z^a \\)\n\nSince b^{a(1-k)} = b^{-a(k-1)} which for k \u2265 2, k-1 \u2265 1, so exponent -a(k-1) \u2264 -a < 0, and since b is large, these terms are small.\n\nThe right side has \\( \\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{1}{a} \\left( a z + \\binom{a}{2} b^{-a} z^2 + \\binom{a}{3} b^{-2a} z^3 + \\cdots + \\binom{a}{a} b^{-a(a-1)} z^a \\right) = z + \\frac{\\binom{a}{2}}{a} b^{-a} z^2 + \\frac{\\binom{a}{3}}{a} b^{-2a} z^3 + \\cdots + \\frac{\\binom{a}{a}}{a} b^{-a(a-1)} z^a \\)\n\nNow \\( \\frac{\\binom{a}{k}}{a} = \\frac{1}{a} \\frac{a!}{k! (a-k)!} = \\frac{(a-1)!}{k! (a-k)!} = \\binom{a-1}{k-1} \\frac{1}{k} \\), but perhaps not necessary.\n\nNotice that the terms after z are of order b^{-a} z^2, which for large b, are small.\n\nThe equation is:\n\nLeft side: b^a + \\lfloor b^{a-1} \\epsilon \\rfloor = b^a + \\lfloor z \\rfloor\n\nRight side: b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor = b^a + \\left\\lfloor z + \\frac{\\binom{a}{2}}{a} b^{-a} z^2 + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a} b^{-a(a-1)} z^a \\right\\rfloor\n\nSince b^a is common, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\lfloor z \\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor z + \\sum_{k=2}^a \\frac{\\binom{a}{k}}{a} b^{a(1-k)} z^k \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nDenote the sum as S_b(z) = \\sum_{k=2}^a c_k b^{-a(k-1)} z^k, where c_k are some constants depending on a.\n\nSpecifically, c_k = \\frac{\\binom{a}{k}}{a}, and the exponent is -a(k-1).\n\nSince a is fixed, and b is large, for each fixed z, S_b(z) \u2192 0 as b \u2192 \u221e, but z might depend on b, because z = b^{a-1} \\epsilon, and \\epsilon depends on x and b.\n\nRecall that \\epsilon = y - b, and y = (b^a + x)^{1/a}, so for fixed x, as b \u2192 \u221e, \\epsilon \u2192 0, and z = b^{a-1} \\epsilon might behave differently depending on x.\n\nThe equation must hold for all b, not just large b. So I need to consider the behavior for all b.\n\nThe equation \\lfloor z \\rfloor = \\lfloor z + \\delta_b \\rfloor, where \\delta_b = S_b(z) is the sum, which is small when b is large.\n\nFor \\lfloor z \\rfloor = \\lfloor z + \\delta \\rfloor, this is true if and only if the fractional part of z satisfies {z} < 1 - \\delta or something? No.\n\nActually, \\lfloor u \\rfloor = \\lfloor u + d \\rfloor for d < 1, but it's not always true.\n\nSpecifically, \\lfloor u \\rfloor = \\lfloor u + d \\rfloor if and only if {u} + d < 1, where {u} is the fractional part of u, i.e., 0 \u2264 {u} < 1 - d or if d is integer, but d is small.\n\nMore carefully: if d \u2265 0, then \\lfloor u + d \\rfloor = \\lfloor u \\rfloor + \\lfloor {u} + d \\rfloor, and since 0 \u2264 {u} < 1, \\lfloor {u} + d \\rfloor is 0 if {u} + d < 1, and 1 if {u} + d \u2265 1. So \\lfloor u + d \\rfloor = \\lfloor u \\rfloor if {u} + d < 1, and \\lfloor u \\rfloor + 1 if {u} + d \u2265 1.\n\nTherefore, \\lfloor u \\rfloor = \\lfloor u + d \\rfloor iff {u} + d < 1.\n\nIf d < 0, it might be different, but in this case, what is the sign of \\delta_b = S_b(z)?\n\nS_b(z) = \\frac{x}{a} - z + something, but from earlier, \\frac{x}{a} = z + S_b(z), and S_b(z) is the sum from k=2 to a, which for x fixed, as b large, is small, but let's see the sign.\n\ny = (b^a + x)^{1/a} > 0, b > 0, so \\epsilon = y - b could be positive or negative.\n\nIf x > 0, y > b, \\epsilon > 0, so z = b^{a-1} \\epsilon > 0.\n\nIf x < 0, y < b, \\epsilon < 0, z < 0.\n\nIn S_b(z), we have terms like b^{-a(k-1)} z^k. Since b^{-a(k-1)} > 0, and z^k, if z > 0, all terms positive, so S_b(z) > 0.\n\nIf z < 0, and k even, z^k > 0, k odd, z^k < 0, but since a is even, for k even, positive, k odd, negative, but b^{-a(k-1)} is always positive, so the sign of each term depends on the sign of z^k.\n\nMoreover, the magnitude: for large b, the dominant term in S_b(z) is the k=2 term, since b^{-a} is the largest exponent (least negative for k=2).\n\nExponent of b is -a(k-1), so for k=2, -a, for k=3, -2a, etc, so smallest in magnitude is k=2 term.\n\nSo for large b, S_b(z) ~ \\frac{\\binom{a}{2}}{a} b^{-a} z^2.\n\nSince \\binom{a}{2}/a = \\frac{a(a-1)/2}{a} = \\frac{a-1}{2} > 0 for a\u22652.\n\nSo for large b, S_b(z) is positive if z \u2260 0, but if z < 0, and since a even, z^2 > 0, so S_b(z) > 0 for all z \u2260 0.\n\nWhen z=0, S_b(0)=0.\n\nBut z=0 when \\epsilon=0, i.e., x=0, but let's see.\n\nSo in all cases, for b large, S_b(z) > 0 if z \u2260 0, and S_b(0) = 0.\n\nNow, back to the equation:\n\n\\lfloor z \\rfloor = \\lfloor z + \\delta_b \\rfloor, with \\delta_b = S_b(z) > 0 for z \u2260 0.\n\nAs we said, this holds iff the fractional part {z} satisfies {z} + \\delta_b < 1, i.e., {z} < 1 - \\delta_b.\n\nBut \\delta_b > 0 and small for large b, so this requires that {z} is not too close to 1, but since \\delta_b \u2192 0 as b\u2192\u221e, for the equality to hold for all large b, we need {z} < 1, which is always true, but more stringently, since \\delta_b can be small, we need {z} < 1 - \\delta_b for each b, which as b\u2192\u221e, \\delta_b\u21920, so {z} must be less than 1, but it could be arbitrarily close to 1 as long as \\delta_b < 1 - {z}, but for fixed z, as b\u2192\u221e, \\delta_b\u21920, so for large b, \\delta_b < 1 - {z} is satisfied if {z} <1, which is true. But z depends on b, because z = b^{a-1} \\epsilon, and \\epsilon depends on b and x.\n\nFor each fixed x, and for each b, z is determined, so we need for each b, the equality.\n\nFor large b, if z is such that \\delta_b is small, the equality may hold as long as {z} + \\delta_b <1, but if {z} is close to 1, and \\delta_b is not small enough, it might not hold.\n\nBut in our case, for fixed x, as b\u2192\u221e, \\epsilon = y - b = (b^a + x)^{1/a} - b.\n\nFor large b, (b^a + x)^{1/a} = b (1 + x b^{-a})^{1/a} = b (1 + \\frac{x}{a} b^{-a} + O(b^{-2a})) by binomial expansion.\n\nSo \\epsilon = b [1 + \\frac{x}{a} b^{-a} + O(b^{-2a}) ] - b = \\frac{x}{a} b^{1-a} + O(b^{1-2a})\n\nThen z = b^{a-1} \\epsilon = b^{a-1} \\cdot \\frac{x}{a} b^{1-a} + O(b^{a-1} b^{1-2a}) = \\frac{x}{a} + O(b^{-a})\n\nSince b^{a-1} b^{1-a} = b^0 = 1, and b^{a-1} b^{1-2a} = b^{-a}.\n\nSo z = \\frac{x}{a} + O(b^{-a}) as b\u2192\u221e.\n\nThus, for large b, z approaches \\frac{x}{a}, and the error is O(b^{-a}).\n\nNow, \\delta_b = S_b(z) ~ \\frac{a-1}{2} b^{-a} z^2 = O(b^{-a}) since z is bounded (approaches x/a).\n\nIn fact, since z \u2192 x/a, \\delta_b = c b^{-a} + o(b^{-a}) for some constant c depending on x and a.\n\nSpecifically, the k=2 term is \\frac{\\binom{a}{2}}{a} b^{-a} z^2 = \\frac{a-1}{2} b^{-a} (x/a)^2 + o(b^{-a}) = \\frac{a-1}{2a} x^2 b^{-a} + o(b^{-a})\n\nThe higher terms are smaller, O(b^{-2a}).\n\nNow, the fractional part: z = \\frac{x}{a} + r_b, where r_b = O(b^{-a}).\n\nThe equation requires \\lfloor z \\rfloor = \\lfloor z + \\delta_b \\rfloor, which as we said, since \\delta_b > 0, is equivalent to {z} + \\delta_b < 1.\n\n{z} is the fractional part of z, so 0 \u2264 {z} < 1.\n\nAs b\u2192\u221e, z \u2192 x/a, so {z} \u2192 {x/a}, but since r_b \u21920, if {x/a} <1, then for large b, {z} is close to {x/a}, and \\delta_b \u21920, so {z} + \\delta_b <1 for large b.\n\nHowever, if {x/a} =0, i.e., x/a is integer, then z \u2192 integer, so for large b, z is close to an integer from below or above, but since r_b = O(b^{-a}), it could be slightly less or slightly more than the integer.\n\nBut in our case, z = x/a + r_b, with r_b \u21920, and if x/a is integer, z approaches an integer.\n\nNow, \\lfloor z \\rfloor and \\lfloor z + \\delta_b \\rfloor: if z is not integer, for large b it's close to integer, but since it approaches the integer, say k, then for large b, z < k or z > k, but since r_b \u21920, and \\delta_b \u21920, we need to see the behavior.\n\nBut the equation must hold for all b, not just large b, so we need to consider for all b.\n\nMoreover, for x/a not integer, it might still hold for large b, but may not for small b.\n\nPerhaps x must be such that z is integer for all b? But z depends on b, so probably not.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps for each b, the expression must be constant or something.\n\nLet me try to plug in small values of b to get constraints on x.\n\nSince a is even positive integer, I can fix a, say a=2, and solve for that, then generalize.\n\nLet a=2. Then the equation is for all positive integers b,\n\n\\[ \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{b^2 + x} \\cdot b \\right\\rfloor = b^2 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nBecause \\sqrt[2]{b^2 + x} = \\sqrt{b^2 + x}, and b^{a-1} = b^{1} = b.\n\nLeft side: \\lfloor b \\sqrt{b^2 + x} \\rfloor\n\nSet y = \\sqrt{b^2 + x}, so y > 0, and y^2 = b^2 + x, so x = y^2 - b^2.\n\nLeft side: \\lfloor b y \\rfloor\n\nRight side: b^2 + \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor = b^2 + \\lfloor (y^2 - b^2)/2 \\rfloor\n\nFrom earlier, with a=2, z = b^{a-1} \\epsilon = b^{1} \\epsilon, and \\epsilon = y - b, so z = b (y - b)\n\nThen left side: b^2 + \\lfloor z \\rfloor, as before.\n\nWith a=2, \\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{x}{2}, and z = b (y - b)\n\nBut y = \\sqrt{b^2 + x}, so z = b (\\sqrt{b^2 + x} - b)\n\nNow the equation is \\lfloor z \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor? No.\n\nFrom earlier general, we have \\lfloor z \\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor z + S_b(z) \\right\\rfloor, but for a=2, let's compute explicitly.\n\nx = y^2 - b^2 = (y - b)(y + b)\n\nSince y \u2248 b, y + b \u2248 2b, so x \u2248 (y - b) * 2b = 2b \\epsilon, but \\epsilon = y - b, so z = b \\epsilon, so x \u2248 2 z.\n\nMore precisely, x = (y - b)(y + b) = \\epsilon (2b + \\epsilon)\n\nSo \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{\\epsilon (2b + \\epsilon)}{2} = \\epsilon b + \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2} = z + \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\n\nSince z = b \\epsilon.\n\nFor a=2, \\delta_b = S_b(z) = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}, since only k=2 term, \\binom{2}{2}/2 * b^{2(1-2)} z^2? Earlier formula for S_b(z).\n\nFrom above, \\frac{x}{2} = z + \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\n\nBut \\epsilon = z / b, so \\frac{x}{2} = z + \\frac{(z/b)^2}{2} = z + \\frac{z^2}{2b^2}\n\nSo for a=2, the sum is \\frac{z^2}{2b^2}\n\nAnd the equation is \\lfloor z \\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor z + \\frac{z^2}{2b^2} \\right\\rfloor\n\nSince \\frac{z^2}{2b^2} > 0 for z \u2260 0, this holds iff the fractional part {z} < 1 - \\frac{z^2}{2b^2}\n\nNow z = b (\\sqrt{b^2 + x} - b)\n\nI could solve for x such that this holds for all b.\n\nNote that \\sqrt{b^2 + x} - b = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{b^2 + x} + b} by rationalizing.\n\nSo z = b \\cdot \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{b^2 + x} + b} = \\frac{b x}{b (\\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1)} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1}\n\nAs b\u2192\u221e, z \u2192 x / (1+1) = x/2, as before.\n\nThe condition is that for each b, {z} < 1 - \\frac{z^2}{2b^2}\n\nBut {z} is between 0 and 1, and the right side is close to 1 for large b, but for small b, it might be restrictive.\n\nPerhaps z is an integer for all b. Is that possible? If z is integer, then left side is |z|, and right side |z + something|, but \\delta_b = z^2/(2b^2) >0, so |z + \\delta_b| = |z| if \\delta_b <1, which it is for large b, but for small b, if z large, might not hold, but z depends on b.\n\nSuppose for each b, z is integer. Then \\lfloor z \\rfloor = z, and \\lfloor z + \\delta_b \\rfloor = z if {z} + \\delta_b <1, but since z integer, {z}=0, so need 0 + \\delta_b <1, i.e. \\delta_b <1.\n\n\\delta_b = z^2/(2b^2), so z^2 < 2b^2.\n\nBut z is integer, and z = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1}, which for fixed x, as b varies, z varies.\n\nIf z is to be integer for all b, it must be constant, but for different b, it's different unless x=0, but let's see.\n\nFor example, b=1, z = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1 + x} + 1}\n\nb=2, z = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1 + x/4} + 1} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4 + x}/2 + 1} = \\frac{x}{( \\sqrt{4+x} + 2)/2} = \\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{4+x} + 2}\n\nSet this equal to an integer for each b, but it's unlikely unless x is chosen carefully.\n\nPerhaps z is half-integer or something, but let's try specific b.\n\nLet me try b=1 for a=2.\n\nWhen b=1, the equation is:\n\n\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{1 + x} \\cdot 1 \\right\\rfloor = 1^2 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\implies \\lfloor \\sqrt{1 + x} \\rfloor = 1 + \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor\n\nSince x \u2265 -1, as established earlier.\n\nSet k = \\lfloor \\sqrt{1 + x} \\rfloor, which is an integer.\n\nAlso, let m = \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor, integer.\n\nThen k = 1 + m.\n\nNow, k \u2264 \\sqrt{1 + x} < k+1, and m \u2264 x/2 < m+1.\n\nSince k = m+1, so m+1 \u2264 \\sqrt{1 + x} < m+2, and m \u2264 x/2 < m+1.\n\nFrom m+1 \u2264 \\sqrt{1 + x}, square both sides: (m+1)^2 \u2264 1 + x, so x \u2265 (m+1)^2 - 1 = m^2 + 2m +1 -1 = m^2 + 2m.\n\nFrom \\sqrt{1 + x} < m+2, so 1 + x < (m+2)^2, x < (m+2)^2 - 1 = m^2 + 4m + 4 -1 = m^2 + 4m + 3.\n\nAlso, from m \u2264 x/2 < m+1, so 2m \u2264 x < 2m+2.\n\nNow, combining, x \u2265 m^2 + 2m and x < m^2 + 4m + 3, and 2m \u2264 x < 2m+2.\n\nAlso, since x \u2265 -1, m = \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor, so for different m, we have intervals.\n\nThe inequalities must hold for some m.\n\nSpecifically, for each m, the interval [2m, 2m+2) must intersect [m^2 + 2m, m^2 + 4m + 3).\n\nBut since k = m+1, and for each b, but here for b=1.\n\nNote that m^2 + 2m = m(m+2), and 2m \u2264 x < 2m+2.\n\nFor the intersection to be non-empty, we need m^2 + 2m < 2m+2? Because the lower bound m^2+2m must be less than upper bound 2m+2.\n\nm^2 + 2m < 2m + 2 \u21d2 m^2 < 2 \u21d2 |m| < \\sqrt{2} \u22481.414, so m \u22641 since integer.\n\nSimilarly, lower bound 2m \u2264 m^2 + 4m + 3, which is always true for m \u22650, but m can be negative.\n\nLet's consider possible m.\n\nm integer, and x \u2265 -1, so m = \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor \u2265 \\lfloor -1/2 \\rfloor = -1, since -1 \u2264 -0.5 < 0, so \\lfloor -0.5 \\rfloor = -1.\n\nSo m \u2265 -1.\n\nCase m = -1:\n\nThen 2m \u2264 x < 2m+2 \u21d2 -2 \u2264 x < 0.\n\nAnd x \u2265 m^2 + 2m = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) = 1 - 2 = -1.\n\nx < m^2 + 4m + 3 = 1 -4 +3 = 0.\n\nSo -1 \u2264 x < 0.\n\nCase m=0:\n\n2(0) \u2264 x < 2(0)+2 \u21d2 0 \u2264 x < 2.\n\nx \u2265 0^2 + 2(0) = 0.\n\nx < 0 + 0 + 3 = 3, but already x<2.\n\nSo 0 \u2264 x < 2.\n\nCase m=1:\n\n2(1) \u2264 x < 4? 2m \u2264 x < 2m+2 \u21d2 2 \u2264 x < 4.\n\nx \u2265 (1)^2 + 2(1) = 1+2=3.\n\nx < 1 + 4 + 3 =8, but already x<4.\n\nSo 3 \u2264 x < 4.\n\nCase m=2:\n\n2(2) \u2264 x < 6? 4 \u2264 x < 6.\n\nx \u2265 4 + 4 =8? m^2 + 2m =4+4=8.\n\nx < m^2 +4m+3=4+8+3=15.\n\nBut 8 \u2264 x <6? 8 and 6, no overlap since 8>6. So no solution for m\u22652.\n\nSimilarly, m=-1,0,1 have solutions.\n\nBut this is only for b=1. For other b, it must also hold.\n\nNow, for b=2, a=2.\n\nEquation: \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{4 + x} \\cdot 2 \\right\\rfloor = 4 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor\n\nSo \\lfloor 2 \\sqrt{4 + x} \\rfloor = 4 + \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor\n\nNow, we have constraints from b=1: x in [-1,0) or [0,2) or [3,4)\n\nNow, check for each interval.\n\nFirst, suppose x in [-1,0).\n\nFor b=2, \\lfloor 2 \\sqrt{4 + x} \\rfloor\n\nSince x \u2265 -1, 4+x \u22653, \\sqrt{4+x} \u2265 \\sqrt{3} >1.7, so 2\\sqrt{4+x} > 3.4, so \\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor \\geq 3.\n\nActual: min when x=-1, \\sqrt{4-1}=\\sqrt{3}\u22481.732, times 2 is 3.464, floor 3.\n\nMax when x\u21920-, \\sqrt{4+0}=2, 2*2=4, but since x<0, \\sqrt{4+x}<2, so less than 4, so floor at most 3? When x close to 0, say x=-0.01, \\sqrt{3.99}\u22481.9975, times 2\u22483.995, floor 3.\n\nIs it always 3 for x in [-1,0)? When x=-1, \u22483.464, floor 3; when x\u21920-, \u21923.999..., floor still 3. So \\lfloor 2 \\sqrt{4+x} \\rfloor =3 for x in [-1,0).\n\nNow right side: 4 + \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor\n\nx in [-1,0), so x/2 in [-0.5, 0), \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor = -1.\n\nSo 4 + (-1) =3.\n\nSo left side=3, right side=3, so holds for b=2 when x in [-1,0).\n\nBut we need for all b, so check for other b.\n\nNow, for b=3, a=2.\n\nEquation: \\lfloor 3 \\sqrt{9 + x} \\rfloor = 9 + \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor\n\nFor x in [-1,0), left side: \\sqrt{9+x} > \\sqrt{8}\u22482.828, so 3*2.828\u22488.484, floor at least 8.\n\nWhen x=-1, \\sqrt{8}\u22482.828, 3*2.828\u22488.484, floor 8.\n\nWhen x\u21920-, \\sqrt{9}\u22483, 3*3=9, but x<0, so <9, say 8.999, floor 8? When x close to 0, say x=-0.01, \\sqrt{8.99}\u22482.9983, times 3\u22488.995, floor 8. So always 8 for x in [-1,0).\n\nRight side: 9 + \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor =9 + \\lfloor <0 \\rfloor =9 + (-1)=8? \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor for x in [-0.5,0) is -1? x/2 \u2265 -0.5, and since x\u2265-1, x/2 \u2265 -0.5, and x/2 <0, so \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor = -1 for x in [-1,0)? When x in [-1,-0.5), x/2 in [-0.5,-0.25), \\lfloor \\rfloor = -1; when x in [-0.5,0), x/2 in [-0.25,0), \\lfloor \\rfloor = -1. Yes, so 9 + (-1)=8. So equal to 8. So for b=3, also holds.\n\nNow for b=4.\n\n\\lfloor 4 \\sqrt{16 + x} \\rfloor = 16 + \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor\n\nx in [-1,0), so \\sqrt{16+x} > \\sqrt{15}\u22483.873, so 4",
      "<think>\nI have this problem: Let \\( a \\) be an even positive integer. I need to find all real numbers \\( x \\) such that for every positive integer \\( b \\), the equation\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x } \\cdot b^{a-1} \\right\\rfloor = b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nholds. The floor function is involved, and \\( a \\) is even.\n\nFirst, since \\( a \\) is even, \\( \\sqrt[a]{y} \\) is defined for all real \\( y \\geq 0 \\), so that's fine. Also, because it's an even root, it's non-negative, which is good for the floor function.\n\nThe equation must hold for every positive integer \\( b \\). That suggests I should try small values of \\( b \\) or consider the behavior as \\( b \\) gets large.\n\nLet me denote the left side: \\( L = \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} \\cdot b^{a-1} \\right\\rfloor \\)\n\nAnd the right side: \\( R = b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor \\)\n\nSince \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor \\) is an integer, and \\( b^a \\) is also an integer for integer \\( b \\), so R is an integer. L is also an integer by definition of floor function. So both sides are integers, and they are equal.\n\nNow, the floor function on the left suggests that \\( \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} \\cdot b^{a-1} \\) is slightly less than some integer, but since it's equal to an integer, it must be that the expression inside is at least that integer and less than the next integer.\n\nBut it might be better to consider the fractional part or inequalities.\n\nI recall that for any real number y, \\( \\lfloor y \\rfloor = n \\) means \\( n \\leq y < n+1 \\) for some integer n.\n\nSo, for the equality to hold:\n\n\\[\nb^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor \\leq \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} \\cdot b^{a-1} < b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n\\]\n\nLet me denote \\( k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor \\), so k is an integer, and x = k a + f, where 0 \u2264 f < 1, since f is the fractional part when divided by a? No.\n\nx / a = k + {x/a}, where {x/a} is the fractional part, 0 \u2264 {x/a} < 1.\n\nBut in terms of x, x = a k + r, with 0 \u2264 r < a? No.\n\nk = floor(x/a), so let me set d = floor(x/a), an integer, so x = a d + f, with 0 \u2264 f < 1? No.\n\nx / a = d + g, with 0 \u2264 g < 1, so x = a d + a g, and 0 \u2264 a g < a, so let r = a g, then 0 \u2264 r < a, and x = a d + r.\n\nI think it's better to write x = a d + r with 0 \u2264 r < a, d integer.\n\nBut r is real, not necessarily integer.\n\nIn the floor term, floor(x/a) = d, since r < a.\n\nx/a = d + r/a, so floor(x/a) = d, and 0 \u2264 r/a < 1.\n\nNow, the right side is b^a + d.\n\nThe inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\nb^a + d \\leq b^{a-1} \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} < b^a + d + 1\n\\]\n\nI can divide both sides by b^{a-1}, since b \u2265 1.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nb + \\frac{d}{b^{a-1}} \\leq \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} < b + \\frac{d + 1}{b^{a-1}}\n\\]\n\nSince b^{a-1} > 0.\n\nNow, let me set y = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x}, so y is the a-th root.\n\nThen the inequality is:\n\n\\[\nb + \\frac{d}{b^{a-1}} \\leq y < b + \\frac{d + 1}{b^{a-1}}\n\\]\n\nBut y = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x}, so raising to the a-th power:\n\nLeft part: \\( \\left( b + \\frac{d}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^a \\leq b^a + x \\)\n\nRight part: \\( b^a + x < \\left( b + \\frac{d+1}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^a \\)\n\nSince x is fixed, and this must hold for all b, I need to consider the expansion of these binomials.\n\nRecall that for large b, (b + c)^a can be expanded using binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\( \\left( b + \\frac{c}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^a = b^a + a b^{a-1} \\cdot \\frac{c}{b^{a-1}} + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\left( \\frac{c}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^2 + \\cdots + \\left( \\frac{c}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^a \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= b^a + a c + \\binom{a}{2} c^2 b^{a-2 - 2(a-1)} + \\cdots let me compute the exponents.\n\nFirst term: b^a\n\nSecond term: \\binom{a}{1} b^{a-1} \\cdot (c / b^{a-1}) = a c \\cdot b^{a-1} / b^{a-1} = a c\n\nThe exponent: b^{a-1} times (c b^{-(a-1})}) = c b^{a-1 - (a-1)} = c b^0 = c\n\nSo, \\binom{a}{1} b^{a-1} (c / b^{a-1}) = a c\n\nThird term: \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} (c / b^{a-1})^2 = \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} c^2 b^{-2(a-1)} = \\binom{a}{2} c^2 b^{a-2 - 2a + 2} = \\binom{a}{2} c^2 b^{-a}\n\nSince a-2 -2a +2 = -a\n\nSimilarly, higher terms: for k \u2265 2, \\binom{a}{k} b^{a-k} (c / b^{a-1})^k = \\binom{a}{k} c^k b^{a-k - k(a-1)} = \\binom{a}{k} c^k b^{a(1-k) + k - k} let me compute exponent:\n\na - k - k(a-1) = a - k - k a + k = a - k a + k - k? No:\n\na - k - k(a-1) = a - k - k a + k = a(1 - k) - k + k = a(1-k)\n\nSince -k + k cancels? No:\n\na - k - k(a-1) = a - k - k a + k = (a - k a) + (-k + k) = a(1-k) + 0 = a(1-k)\n\n- k + k is zero, yes.\n\nSo b^{a(1-k)} = b^{a - a k}\n\nSince k \u2265 2, a(1-k) \u2264 a(1-2) = -a < 0 for a \u2265 2, which it is since a even positive integer, a \u2265 2.\n\na is at least 2.\n\nSo for k \u2265 2, the exponent a(1-k) \u2264 -a < 0, so as b \u2192 \u221e, these terms go to zero.\n\nSpecifically, the third term and higher are O(b^{-a}) as b \u2192 \u221e.\n\nNow back to the inequalities.\n\nFrom left inequality:\n\n\\( \\left( b + \\frac{d}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^a \\leq b^a + x \\)\n\nBut \\( \\left( b + \\frac{d}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^a = b^a + a d + \\binom{a}{2} d^2 b^{-a} + O(b^{-2a}) \\) since higher terms smaller.\n\nMore precisely, as above, it's b^a + a d + \\binom{a}{2} d^2 b^{a(1-2)} + \\cdots = b^a + a d + O(b^{-a})\n\nSince for k=2, b^{a(1-2)} = b^{-a}, and higher k have b to even more negative powers.\n\nSimilarly for the other side.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nb^a + a d + O(b^{-a}) \\leq b^a + x\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\na d + O(b^{-a}) \\leq x\n\\]\n\nAs b \u2192 \u221e, O(b^{-a}) \u2192 0, so a d \u2264 x.\n\nBut x = a d + r with 0 \u2264 r < a, so x \u2265 a d, which is true, and as b \u2192 \u221e, the inequality becomes x \u2265 a d, which is equality in the limit? But strict for finite b.\n\nThe inequality is a d + O(b^{-a}) \u2264 x, and since O(b^{-a}) \u2192 0 as b \u2192 \u221e, for this to hold for all large b, we must have a d \u2264 x, which is always true by definition of d.\n\nBut it might be strict for some b, but since it's \u2264, and x is fixed, it's fine, but I need more.\n\nSimilarly, from the right inequality:\n\nb^a + x < \\left( b + \\frac{d+1}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^a\n\nAnd \\left( b + \\frac{d+1}{b^{a-1}} \\right)^a = b^a + a(d+1) + O(b^{-a})\n\nSo,\n\nb^a + x < b^a + a(d+1) + O(b^{-a})\n\nThus,\n\nx < a(d+1) + O(b^{-a})\n\nAs b \u2192 \u221e, O(b^{-a}) \u2192 0, so x < a(d+1)\n\nBut since d = floor(x/a), x < a(d+1) is always true, because x < a d + a = a(d+1).\n\nx = a d + r, r < a, so x < a d + a = a(d+1), so again, always true.\n\nSo in the limit, the inequalities are automatically satisfied, but for finite b, the O(b^{-a}) terms might cause issues, so I need to ensure that for all b, the inequality holds with the error terms.\n\nI need a tighter bound.\n\nI should write the inequalities more carefully.\n\nSo, from the floor equality, we have:\n\n\\[\nb^a + d \\leq b^{a-1} \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} < b^a + d + 1\n\\]\n\nSet z = b^{a-1} \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x}\n\nThen d \u2264 z - b^a < d+1\n\nEarlier.\n\nNow, z - b^a = b^{a-1} \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} - b^a\n\nSet w = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} - b\n\nThen z - b^a = b^{a-1} (b + w) - b^a = b^a + b^{a-1} w - b^a = b^{a-1} w\n\nSo z - b^a = b^{a-1} w\n\nAnd w = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} - b\n\nNow the inequality is:\n\nd \u2264 b^{a-1} w < d+1\n\nBut w = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} - b\n\nNow, I can express w in terms of x.\n\nNote that (b + w)^a = b^a + x\n\nSo, by binomial theorem:\n\n(b + w)^a = b^a + a b^{a-1} w + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} w^2 + \\cdots + w^a = b^a + x\n\nSo,\n\na b^{a-1} w + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} w^2 + \\cdots + w^a = x\n\nNow, from the inequality, d \u2264 b^{a-1} w < d+1\n\nSet v = b^{a-1} w\n\nThen d \u2264 v < d+1\n\nAnd w = v b^{1-a}\n\nThen the equation is:\n\na b^{a-1} (v b^{1-a}) + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} (v b^{1-a})^2 + \\cdots + (v b^{1-a})^a = x\n\nSimplify:\n\na v + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} v^2 b^{2-2a} + \\cdots + v^a b^{a(1-a)} \n\nExponents:\n\nFirst term: a v\n\nSecond term: \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} v^2 b^{-2a + 2} = \\binom{a}{2} v^2 b^{a-2 -2a +2} = \\binom{a}{2} v^2 b^{-a}\n\nThird term: \\binom{a}{3} b^{a-3} v^3 b^{-3a +3} = \\binom{a}{3} v^3 b^{a-3-3a+3} = \\binom{a}{3} v^3 b^{-2a}\n\nGenerally, for the k-th term: \\binom{a}{k} b^{a-k} (v b^{1-a})^k = \\binom{a}{k} v^k b^{a-k + k(1-a)} = \\binom{a}{k} v^k b^{a-k + k - k a} = \\binom{a}{k} v^k b^{a(1-k)}\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo,\n\nx = a v + \\binom{a}{2} v^2 b^{-a} + \\binom{a}{3} v^3 b^{-2a} + \\cdots + v^a b^{a(1-a)}\n\nSince a(1-a) = a - a^2 < 0 for a \u2265 2.\n\nNow, v is between d and d+1, so v is bounded, say |v| \u2264 M for some M, since d is fixed for given x.\n\nBut d depends on x, but for fixed x, d is fixed, so v is in [d, d+1), so bounded.\n\nThus, the terms for k \u2265 2 are O(b^{-a}) as b \u2192 \u221e.\n\nSpecifically, for k=2, b^{-a}, for k=3, b^{-2a}, etc.\n\nSo,\n\nx = a v + O(b^{-a})\n\nNow, since v is between d and d+1, and x is fixed, as b \u2192 \u221e, we must have x = a v + o(1), so v must approach x/a.\n\nBut v is between d and d+1, and d = floor(x/a), so x/a is between d and d+1, so it makes sense.\n\nAs b \u2192 \u221e, v \u2192 x/a, since x = a v + o(1), so v = x/a + o(1)\n\nBut since v must be in [d, d+1), and for large b, v is close to x/a, which is fine.\n\nBut for the equality to hold for all b, including small b, I need to ensure that for all b, v satisfies d \u2264 v < d+1, but v is defined in terms of x and b, so I need the expression to be within that interval.\n\nMoreover, the floor equality requires that v is at least d and less than d+1, but since v is continuous in b, and d is integer, it might be tight.\n\nAnother thought: since the equation must hold for all b, I could set b=1.\n\nTry b=1.\n\nFor b=1, the equation is:\n\nLeft side: \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{1^a + x} \\cdot 1^{a-1} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{1 + x} \\right\\rfloor\n\nRight side: 1^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor = 1 + d\n\nSo,\n\n\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{1 + x} \\right\\rfloor = 1 + d\n\nSince a is even, \\sqrt[a]{y} is defined and non-negative.\n\nSo, \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{1 + x} \\right\\rfloor = 1 + d\n\nWhich means:\n\n1 + d \u2264 \\sqrt[a]{1 + x} < 2 + d\n\nRaising to a-th power, since a even, but the function is increasing for y\u22650, so\n\n(1 + d)^a \u2264 1 + x < (2 + d)^a\n\nNow, x = a d + r with 0 \u2264 r < a, so\n\n(1 + d)^a \u2264 1 + a d + r < (2 + d)^a\n\nr < a, so 1 + a d + r < 1 + a d + a\n\nBut (2 + d)^a could be larger.\n\nThis must hold, but for each d, r must satisfy this.\n\nBut d is determined by x, so for given x, d is fixed, so this gives a constraint on r.\n\nI could solve for x.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps x is such that b^{a-1} \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} is almost integer, and the fractional part is small.\n\nSet u = b^{a-1} \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} - b^a\n\nThen u is between d and d+1, and from earlier, x = a u + higher terms.\n\nBut perhaps for the equality to hold, the higher terms must be controlled.\n\nNotice that for v = b^{a-1} w, and x = a v + \\binom{a}{2} v^2 b^{-a} + O(b^{-2a})\n\nAnd v must satisfy d \u2264 v < d+1.\n\nBut v is close to x/a, which is fixed.\n\nFor the floor to be exactly d, and v to be in [d, d+1), but the equation requires that v is such that when plugged in, x is constant, but x is fixed, v depends on b.\n\nI am considering that for different b, v changes, but the floor condition must hold.\n\nAssume that x is such that \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} is close to b.\n\nSet \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} = b + \\delta, with \\delta small.\n\nThen (b + \\delta)^a = b^a + x\n\nb^a + a b^{a-1} \\delta + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\delta^2 + \\cdots = b^a + x\n\nSo x = a b^{a-1} \\delta + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\delta^2 + \\cdots\n\nThe left side of the original equation is \\left\\lfloor (b + \\delta) b^{a-1} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor b^a + b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor\n\nSince b^a is integer, this is b^a + \\left\\lfloor b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor\n\nThe right side is b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nb^a + \\left\\lfloor b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor = b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor\n\nSo \\left\\lfloor b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor = d\n\nThis is interesting.\n\nSo for each b, \\left\\lfloor b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor = d\n\nBut \\delta depends on b, and x is fixed.\n\nFrom earlier, x = a b^{a-1} \\delta + \\binom{a}{2} b^{a-2} \\delta^2 + \\cdots\n\nBut from the floor, since \\left\\lfloor b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor = d, that means d \u2264 b^{a-1} \\delta < d+1\n\nSo \\delta is between d b^{1-a} and (d+1) b^{1-a}\n\nNow, plug into x:\n\nx = a b^{a-1} \\delta + O( b^{a-2} \\delta^2 )  since the next term has b^{a-2} \\delta^2\n\nAnd since \\delta = O(b^{1-a}), so \\delta^2 = O(b^{2-2a}), so b^{a-2} \\delta^2 = b^{a-2} O(b^{2-2a}) = O(b^{-a})\n\nSimilarly higher terms smaller.\n\nSo x = a b^{a-1} \\delta + O(b^{-a})\n\nBut since b^{a-1} \\delta is between d and d+1, so a b^{a-1} \\delta is between a d and a(d+1)\n\nAnd x is fixed, so for large b, it should be close to a times something.\n\nSpecifically, from x = a b^{a-1} \\delta + O(b^{-a}), and b^{a-1} \\delta = v, with d \u2264 v < d+1, and x = a v + O(b^{-a})\n\nBut since x is fixed, for different b, v must be such that a v is close to x.\n\nBut v is roughly b^{a-1} \\delta, and \\delta is small.\n\nThe key point is that \\left\\lfloor b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor = d for all b.\n\nThat means that for every positive integer b, the fractional part or something.\n\nSince \\left\\lfloor b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor = d, and d is constant, independent of b.\n\nd = floor(x/a), which depends only on x, not on b.\n\nBut for each b, \\left\\lfloor b^{a-1} \\delta \\right\\rfloor = d.\n\nBut \\delta depends on b, since x is fixed, and b varies, \\delta is determined by x and b.\n\nFrom x = a b^{a-1} \\delta + higher terms, and for large b, \\delta is small, but for all b, including small b, we have that b^{a-1} \\delta is in [d, d+1)\n\nMoreover, its floor is exactly d.\n\nNow, since this must hold for all b, perhaps b^{a-1} \\delta is always in [d, d+1), and its floor is d, which is already satisfied if it's in [d, d+1).\n\nThe floor is d means it's in [d, d+1), which is exactly the inequality we have from the floor equality.\n\nBut from the derivation, we have d \u2264 b^{a-1} \\delta < d+1, and the floor is d, which is consistent.\n\nBut this must hold for all b, and also x is related.\n\nPerhaps I need to find when this is possible.\n\nNotice that from x = a b^{a-1} \\delta + higher terms, and b^{a-1} \\delta \u2248 v, and x = a v + O(b^{-a}), and v in [d, d+1), so for large b, x \u2248 a v, but v depends on b, so for different b, v is different, but x is fixed, so a v must be nearly constant.\n\nIn fact, since x = a v + O(b^{-a}), as b \u2192 \u221e, a v \u2192 x, so v \u2192 x/a.\n\nBut for finite b, v is close to x/a.\n\nBut the floor of v is always d, which is floor(x/a).\n\nSo, for each b, v is in [d, d+1), and v \u2192 x/a as b \u2192 \u221e.\n\nSince v \u2192 x/a, and x/a is in [d, d+1), and v must be in [d, d+1) for all b, which is true for large b, but for small b, it might not be, so we need to ensure that for all b, v is in [d, d+1).\n\nMoreover, since v = b^{a-1} \\delta, and \\delta is determined by x.\n\nPerhaps I can solve for \\delta from the equation.\n\nFrom (b + \\delta)^a = b^a + x, so \\delta is the a-th root difference.\n\nFor the floor to be constantly d, it must be that b^{a-1} \\delta is not integer or something, but not necessarily.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps d must be 0, or x is small.\n\nLet me try to assume that x is constant, and see for small b what happens.\n\nLet me set a = 2, since a is even, and a=2 is the smallest, and perhaps it will give me insight.\n\nSo let a=2.\n\nThen the equation is for all b,\n\n\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{b^2 + x}  \\cdot b^{1} \\right\\rfloor = b^2 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor\n\nSince b^{a-1} = b^{1} for a=2.\n\nSo \\left\\lfloor b \\sqrt{b^2 + x} \\right\\rfloor = b^2 + d\n\nWhere d = floor(x/2).\n\nNow, \\left\\lfloor b \\sqrt{b^2 + x} \\right\\rfloor\n\nSet y = b \\sqrt{b^2 + x}\n\nThen y = b \\sqrt{b^2 + x}\n\nThe floor is b^2 + d.\n\nSo b^2 + d \u2264 b \\sqrt{b^2 + x} < b^2 + d + 1\n\nDivide by b (since b\u22651):\n\nb + \\frac{d}{b} \\leq \\sqrt{b^2 + x} < b + \\frac{d+1}{b}\n\nSquare all parts, since all positive.\n\nLeft: \\left( b + \\frac{d}{b} \\right)^2 \\leq b^2 + x\n\nb^2 + 2 d + \\frac{d^2}{b^2} \\leq b^2 + x\n\nSo 2d + \\frac{d^2}{b^2} \\leq x\n\nRight: b^2 + x < \\left( b + \\frac{d+1}{b} \\right)^2 = b^2 + 2(d+1) + \\frac{(d+1)^2}{b^2}\n\nSo b^2 + x < b^2 + 2d + 2 + \\frac{(d+1)^2}{b^2}\n\nThus x < 2d + 2 + \\frac{(d+1)^2}{b^2}\n\nSince this must hold for all b, and x is fixed.\n\nFrom left: x \u2265 2d + \\frac{d^2}{b^2} for all b.\n\nAs b\u2192\u221e, \\frac{d^2}{b^2} \u21920, so x \u2265 2d.\n\nBut since d = floor(x/2), x \u2265 2d always, and equality only if x=2d, i.e., x even integer? No, if x is integer, but x real.\n\nd = floor(x/2), so x \u2265 2d, and x < 2d + 2.\n\nThe inequality x \u2265 2d + \\frac{d^2}{b^2} for all b.\n\nSince \\frac{d^2}{b^2} can be arbitrarily small as b increases, for this to hold for all large b, we must have x \u2265 2d, which we know.\n\nBut for small b, if d > 0, for large b it's ok, but for small b, \\frac{d^2}{b^2} might be large.\n\nSpecifically, for fixed x, d is fixed, and for each b, we need x \u2265 2d + \\frac{d^2}{b^2}\n\nSimilarly, from the right, x < 2d + 2 + \\frac{(d+1)^2}{b^2}\n\nNow, since x < 2d + 2 always, the right inequality is satisfied as long as the constant is there, but for large b it's fine.\n\nThe critical part is that for all b, x \u2265 2d + \\frac{d^2}{b^2}\n\nSince b is positive integer, the smallest b is 1.\n\nFor b=1, we need x \u2265 2d + \\frac{d^2}{1^2} = 2d + d^2\n\nFrom the right, for b=1, x < 2d + 2 + (d+1)^2 / 1 = 2d + 2 + d^2 + 2d + 1 = d^2 + 4d + 3? No\n\n\\left( b + \\frac{d+1}{b} \\right)^2 for b=1: \\left(1 + (d+1)\\right)^2 = (d+2)^2 = d^2 + 4d + 4? Earlier I had.\n\nFor b=1, right inequality: x < 2d + 2 + \\frac{(d+1)^2}{b^2} = 2d + 2 + (d+1)^2 for b=1.\n\nSince b=1, \\frac{(d+1)^2}{1} = (d+1)^2.\n\nSo x < 2d + 2 + (d+1)^2 = 2d + 2 + d^2 + 2d + 1 = d^2 + 4d + 3\n\nSimilarly, from left, for b=1: x \u2265 2d + d^2\n\nBut also from earlier when I did b=1 directly, I had (1+d)^2 \u2264 1 + x < (2+d)^2\n\nFor a=2, b=1, left side \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{1 + x} \\right\\rfloor = 1 + d, so 1 + d \u2264 \\sqrt{1+x} < 2 + d, so (1+d)^2 \u2264 1+x < (2+d)^2\n\nWhich is 1 + 2d + d^2 \u2264 1 + x < 4 + 4d + d^2? (2+d)^2 = 4 + 4d + d^2\n\nSo 1 + 2d + d^2 \u2264 1 + x < 4 + 4d + d^2, so 2d + d^2 \u2264 x < 4 + 4d + d^2\n\nBut since d = floor(x/2), and x \u2265 2d, x < 2d + 2, so the upper bound 4+4d+d^2 is larger than 2d+2 for d \u2265 0, since d integer \u22650, as a even positive, x real, d integer could be negative? But x is real, and in the expression, for b positive integer, b^a + x, for b=1, 1+x must be non-negative since square root, and a=2, so 1+x \u22650, x\u2265-1.\n\nd = floor(x/2), could be negative if x<0.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom the b=1 case for a=2, we have 2d + d^2 \u2264 x < 2d + 2 + something, but actually from the direct, x \u2265 2d + d^2 and x < 4 + 4d + d^2, but also x < 2d + 2.\n\nNow, the key is that x must also satisfy for other b.\n\nFor example, for b=2.\n\nBut also, from the inequality x \u2265 2d + d^2 / b^2 for all b.\n\nSince this must hold for all b, and d is fixed for given x, the most restrictive is when b is small.\n\nThe maximum of d^2 / b^2 over b is when b=1, since b\u22651 integer, so for b=1, it is d^2, and for larger b, smaller.\n\nSo the strongest lower bound is x \u2265 2d + d^2 for b=1.\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound x < 2d + 2 + (d+1)^2 / b^2, and this is minimized when b large, so as b\u2192\u221e, x < 2d + 2, which is already true.\n\nBut for small b, it could be larger, but since it's an upper bound, the strongest is when the right side is smallest, which is for large b, but for large b, it approaches 2d+2, and since x < 2d+2 is always true, the binding constraint is from the lower bound.\n\nSpecifically, for the lower bound, we have x \u2265 2d + d^2\n\nBut since d = floor(x/2), and x < 2d + 2, so 2d \u2264 x < 2d + 2.\n\nNow, x \u2265 2d + d^2\n\nd is integer, so d^2 is integer.\n\nx must be at least 2d + d^2, but 2d + d^2 could be larger than 2d, so for d \u2265 1, d^2 \u22651, so x must be at least 2d + d^2 > 2d.\n\nBut by definition of d, x < 2d + 2.\n\nFor example, if d=0, then x \u2265 0 + 0 =0, and since d=0, x<2, so 0\u2264 x <2.\n\nBut d=0 means floor(x/2)=0, so 0\u2264 x <2, which is consistent.\n\nIf d=1, x \u2265 2*1 +1^2 =3, and d=1 means floor(x/2)=1, so 2\u2264 x <4.\n\nBut x\u22653, so 3\u2264 x <4.\n\nSimilarly, for d=2, x\u2265 2*2 +4=8, and 4\u2264 x <6? But 8>6, contradiction.\n\nd=2, x\u2265 2d + d^2 =4+4=8, but d= floor(x/2)=2 implies 4\u2264 x <6, but 8>6, so no overlap.\n\nSimilarly for higher d.\n\nWhat about d negative?\n\nSuppose d=-1.\n\nd= floor(x/2)= -1, so -2 \u2264 x <0.\n\nThen x \u2265 2d + d^2 = 2*(-1) + (-1)^2 = -2 +1 = -1\n\nSo x \u2265 -1 and -2 \u2264 x <0, so -1 \u2264 x <0.\n\nNow, also for b=1, we have (1+d)^2 \u2264 1+x < (2+d)^2, d=-1, so (1-1)^2=0 \u22641+x < (2-1)^2=1, so 0\u22641+x<1, thus -1\u2264x<0, same as above.\n\nBut is this sufficient? We need to check for other b.\n\nFirst, for a=2, possible cases: d=0, x in [0,2); d=1, x in [3,4); d=-1, x in [-1,0)\n\nd=2 impossible, as we saw.\n\nd= -2: d= floor(x/2)= -2, so -4\u2264 x < -2.\n\nThen x \u2265 2d + d^2 = 2*(-2) + 4 = -4+4=0\n\nBut x< -2 <0, contradiction. So d\u2264 -2 impossible.\n\nd= -1: x \u2265 -1, and x<0, so [-1,0)\n\nd=0: [0,2)\n\nd=1: [3,4)\n\nBut for each, we need to verify if for all b, the equation holds.\n\nAlso, earlier for b=1, it holds, but for larger b?\n\nMoreover, a=2, but in the original problem, a is even, but for a=2, it should work if x in these intervals.\n\nBut probably not all work, need to check.\n\nStart with d=0, so x in [0,2)\n\nThen for all b, we need \\left\\lfloor b \\sqrt{b^2 + x} \\right\\rfloor = b^2 + d = b^2 + 0 = b^2\n\nSince d=0.\n\nSo \\left\\lfloor b \\sqrt{b^2 + x} \\right\\rfloor = b^2\n\nWhich implies that b \\sqrt{b^2 + x} < b^2 + 1, and since it's at least b^2 (since x\u22650), so actually b^2 \\leq b \\sqrt{b^2 + x}",
      "<think>\nI need to solve this problem. It states that a is an even positive integer, and I must find all real numbers x such that for every positive integer b, this equation holds:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x } \\cdot b^{a-1} \\right\\rfloor = b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor\\]\n\nThe floor function and the a-th root make it tricky. Since a is even, the expression inside the root is always non-negative, so that's fine.\n\nThe equation must hold for every positive integer b, which suggests that x might be constant, independent of b. I need to find x that works universally for all b.\n\nLet me denote the left side: L = \\(\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x } \\cdot b^{a-1} \\right\\rfloor\\)\n\nAnd the right side: R = \\(b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor\\)\n\nSince both sides are equal for all b, and R is an integer (because b^a is integer, and floor of something is integer), so L must also be an integer.\n\nBut L is defined as a floor, so it's always integer. That makes sense.\n\nNow, let me simplify the expression inside the floor on the left.\n\nSet y = \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x}, so y is the a-th root of (b^a + x).\n\nThen, the left side is floor( y * b^{a-1} )\n\nNotice that y * b^{a-1} = b^{a-1} * (b^a + x)^{1/a}\n\nI can write it as:\n\ny * b^{a-1} = (b^a + x)^{1/a} * b^{a-1} = b^{(a-1)} (b^a + x)^{1/a} = b^{a - 1} b (1 + \\frac{x}{b^a})^{1/a} / b, no.\n\nb^{(a-1)} * (b^a + x)^{1/a} = b^{a-1} * b (1 + \\frac{x}{b^a})^{1/a} * b^{-1}, messy.\n\nb^{a-1} * (b^a)^{1/a} (1 + \\frac{x}{b^a})^{1/a} = b^{a-1} * b * (1 + \\frac{x}{b^a})^{1/a} = b^a (1 + \\frac{x}{b^a})^{1/a}\n\nOh! So:\n\ny * b^{a-1} = b^a \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{b^a}\\right)^{1/a}\n\nTherefore, the left side is:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor b^a \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{b^a}\\right)^{1/a} \\right\\rfloor\\]\n\nAnd this equals \\(b^a + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor\\)\n\nSince b^a is large when b is large, and x is fixed, \\frac{x}{b^a} becomes small, so I can use the binomial expansion or approximation for (1 + u)^{1/a} when u is small.\n\nSet u = \\frac{x}{b^a}, so for large b, u is small.\n\nThen (1 + u)^{1/a} = 1 + \\frac{1}{a} u + \\frac{\\frac{1}{a} (\\frac{1}{a} - 1)}{2} u^2 + \\cdots\n\nSince a is even and positive integer, this expansion is valid for |u| < 1, which is true for large b.\n\nSo,\n\nb^a (1 + u)^{1/a} = b^a \\left(1 + \\frac{u}{a} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{a} (\\frac{1}{a} - 1)}{2} u^2 + O(u^3) \\right)\n\n= b^a + b^a \\cdot \\frac{u}{a} + b^a \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{a} (\\frac{1}{a} - 1)}{2} u^2 + O(b^a u^3)\n\nBut u = x / b^a, so u^2 = x^2 / b^{2a}, u^3 = x^3 / b^{3a}, etc.\n\nSo,\n\nb^a u = b^a * (x / b^a) = x\n\nb^a u^2 = b^a * (x^2 / b^{2a}) = x^2 / b^a\n\nb^a u^3 = x^3 / b^{2a}\n\nLet's write it:\n\nb^a * (u / a) = b^a * (x / (a b^a)) = x / a\n\nb^a * [ \\frac{1}{a} (\\frac{1}{a} - 1) / 2 ] u^2 = [ \\frac{1}{a} (\\frac{1}{a} - 1) / 2 ] b^a * (x^2 / b^{2a}) = [ \\frac{1}{a} (\\frac{1}{a} - 1) / 2 ] x^2 / b^a\n\nAnd b^a O(u^3) = b^a O(1 / b^{3a}) = O(1 / b^{2a})\n\nSo overall:\n\nb^a (1 + u)^{1/a} = b^a + \\frac{x}{a} + c \\frac{x^2}{b^a} + O(1 / b^{2a})\n\nWhere c = \\frac{1}{a} (\\frac{1}{a} - 1) / 2 = \\frac{1}{2a} (\\frac{1}{a} - 1) = \\frac{1}{2a} \\cdot \\frac{1 - a}{a} = \\frac{1 - a}{2a^2}\n\nSince a \u2265 2 (even positive integer), c is negative, but magnitude small.\n\nNow, the floor of this is set equal to b^a + floor(x / a)\n\nSince b^a is integer, and floor(x / a) is integer, let me denote k = floor(x / a), so k is an integer, and x / a = k + f, where 0 \u2264 f < 1, f is the fractional part.\n\nThe equation is floor of that expression equals b^a + k.\n\nNow, the expression is b^a + \\frac{x}{a} + c \\frac{x^2}{b^a} + O(1 / b^{2a})\n\n= b^a + (k + f) + c \\frac{x^2}{b^a} + O(1 / b^{2a})\n\nSo floor( b^a + k + f + c \\frac{x^2}{b^a} + O(1 / b^{2a}) ) = b^a + k\n\nSince b^a + k is integer, this means that the fractional part of the expression must be less than 1, but more precisely, for the floor to be exactly b^a + k, we need that the entire expression is at least b^a + k and less than b^a + k + 1.\n\nSo,\n\nb^a + k \u2264 b^a + k + f + c \\frac{x^2}{b^a} + O(1 / b^{2a}) < b^a + k + 1\n\nSubtract b^a + k from all parts:\n\n0 \u2264 f + c \\frac{x^2}{b^a} + O(1 / b^{2a}) < 1\n\nThis must hold for all large b, as b \u2192 \u221e.\n\nAs b \u2192 \u221e, the terms c x^2 / b^a and O(1 / b^{2a}) go to 0, since a \u2265 2.\n\nTherefore, for this inequality to hold for all large b, we must have 0 \u2264 f < 1, but f is already between 0 and 1 by definition, so that doesn't give new information. However, since f is fixed (as x is fixed), and the other terms vanish, the inequality will hold for large b as long as f < 1, which is always true, but when f + c x^2 / b^a is close to 1, it might exceed if not careful, but since it goes to f, and f < 1, for large b it will be less than 1. The lower bound is always satisfied since f \u2265 0.\n\nThe critical part is that f + c x^2 / b^a + ... must be less than 1 for all large b, which it is since it approaches f < 1. But actually, since it approaches f, and f < 1, there is some B such that for b > B, it's less than 1. But the equation must hold for all b, including small b. So for large b it might be okay, but for small b, it might not hold. So I need to consider small b as well.\n\nMoreover, the inequality 0 \u2264 f + c x^2 / b^a + O(1/b^{2a}) < 1 must hold for all b, but for large b, it's approximately 0 \u2264 f < 1, which is true, but for small b, c x^2 / b^a might be significant.\n\nBut in the inequality above, for the floor to be b^a + k, we need f + c x^2 / b^a + O(1/b^{2a}) < 1, which since O term is small, and c is constant, x fixed, this is roughly f < 1 - c x^2 / b^a, but as b large, this is satisfied, but for fixed x, when b is small, it might not hold. However, the equation must hold for all b, so for each b, the expression must satisfy that inequality.\n\nBut in the derivation above, I assumed the expansion, which is only good for |u| < 1, i.e., |x| < b^a, which for fixed x, is true for b large enough that b^a > |x|. So for b large, it's fine, but for b small, I need to check separately.\n\nPerhaps I should consider specific small values of b to get constraints on x.\n\nLet me try b=1.\n\nWhen b=1, the equation becomes:\n\nLeft side: floor( \\sqrt[a]{1^a + x} * 1^{a-1} ) = floor( (1 + x)^{1/a} )\n\nSince a is even, the a-th root is defined for all real, but since a even, (1+x) must be non-negative for the root to be real. The problem says positive integer b, and a even, so \\sqrt[a]{b^a + x} is real only if b^a + x \u2265 0. Since b^a > 0, if x \u2265 0, it's fine, but if x negative, it might be negative, but a even, so the root is defined for all real as long as the argument is non-negative? No, for real numbers, the a-th root for even a is only defined for non-negative arguments, and gives non-negative result.\n\nSo, for the expression to be real, we need b^a + x \u2265 0 for all positive integers b. Since b can be 1, we need 1 + x \u2265 0, i.e., x \u2265 -1.\n\nMoreover, for larger b, b^a \u2192 \u221e, so for each fixed x, when b is large enough, b^a + x > 0, so the binding constraint is x \u2265 -1.\n\nOkay, so x \u2265 -1.\n\nNow for b=1:\n\nLeft side: floor( (1 + x)^{1/a} )\n\nRight side: 1^a + floor(x / a) = 1 + floor(x / a)\n\nSo:\n\nfloor( (1 + x)^{1/a} ) = 1 + floor(x / a)\n\nNow, let me denote k = floor(x / a), so k is integer, and k \u2264 x/a < k+1, so a k \u2264 x < a(k+1)\n\nNow, (1 + x)^{1/a} is some number.\n\nSince x \u2265 -1, 1 + x \u2265 0.\n\nNow, floor of that equals 1 + k.\n\nSo, 1 + k \u2264 (1 + x)^{1/a} < 1 + k + 1 = 2 + k? No, floor is 1+k, so:\n\n1 + k \u2264 (1 + x)^{1/a} < 2 + k\n\nBecause floor is the greatest integer \u2264 the number, so if floor is m, then m \u2264 num < m+1.\n\nSo here m = 1 + k, so:\n\n1 + k \u2264 (1 + x)^{1/a} < 2 + k\n\nNow, since a is even, and 1+x \u2265 0, I can raise to power a.\n\nSo, (1 + k)^a \u2264 1 + x < (2 + k)^a\n\nBecause the function t^a is increasing for t \u2265 0.\n\nNow, x is between a k and a(k+1), and also 1+x \u2265 (1+k)^a and 1+x < (2+k)^a\n\nBut 1 + x < (2 + k)^a\n\nAnd x < a(k+1)\n\nSimilarly, lower bound.\n\nNow, this must hold, but also for other b.\n\nPerhaps for different k, but k depends on x.\n\nSince this must hold for all b, and for each b, the equation must hold, perhaps I can consider the difference.\n\nNotice that in the expression, for the floor to hold, we must have that b^a (1 + u)^{1/a} is close to b^a + x/a.\n\nFrom the expansion, b^a (1 + u)^{1/a} = b^a + \\frac{x}{a} + O(1/b^a) as b\u2192\u221e.\n\nThe floor of this is equal to b^a + floor(x/a)\n\nBut b^a + floor(x/a) is almost k, but floor(x/a) is constant, while the expression is b^a + x/a + O(1/b^a)\n\nThe difference between the expression and b^a + floor(x/a) is [b^a + x/a + O(1/b^a)] - [b^a + k] = (x/a - k) + O(1/b^a) = f + O(1/b^a), where f is the fractional part of x/a.\n\nFor the floor to be exactly b^a + k, we need that the expression is at least b^a + k and less than b^a + k +1.\n\nWhich we have 0 \u2264 f + O(1/b^a) < 1\n\nAs b\u2192\u221e, f + O(1/b^a) \u2192 f, and since 0 \u2264 f < 1, for large b, it will be between 0 and 1 as long as |O(1/b^a)| is small, which it is, so for large b, it's automatically satisfied if 0 \u2264 f < 1, which is true by definition.\n\nThe issue is that it must be less than 1 for all b, but f is fixed, and O(1/b^a) can be positive or negative, but in this case, from the expansion, the next term is c x^2 / b^a with c = (1-a)/(2a^2) < 0 since a\u22652, so it's negative, so f + negative term + smaller term, so for large b, it's less than f < 1, so no problem. Similarly, lower bound is fine since f \u2265 0.\n\nBut this is necessary but not sufficient because for small b, it might not hold. So I need to ensure that for all b, not just large b.\n\nPerhaps the only constraint is from b=1 and the behavior for large b is automatic, but probably not, because for other b, it might impose more constraints.\n\nMaybe x must be such that x/a is integer, so f=0.\n\nLet me try if f=0, i.e., x is multiple of a.\n\nSuppose x = a m for some integer m.\n\nThen floor(x/a) = floor(m) = m\n\nRight side is b^a + m\n\nLeft side: floor( \\sqrt[a]{b^a + a m} \\cdot b^{a-1} ) = floor( b^a (1 + \\frac{a m}{b^a})^{1/a} )\n\nNow, (1 + \\frac{a m}{b^a})^{1/a} = 1 + \\frac{m}{b^a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} a + higher terms? From binomial:\n\n(1 + v)^{1/a} = 1 + \\frac{v}{a} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{a}(\\frac{1}{a}-1)}{2} v^2 + \\cdots with v = a m / b^a\n\nSo b^a (1 + v)^{1/a} = b^a [1 + \\frac{v}{a} + O(v^2)] = b^a [1 + \\frac{a m}{a b^a} + O(\\frac{1}{b^{2a}})] = b^a [1 + \\frac{m}{b^a} + O(\\frac{1}{b^{2a}})] = b^a + m + O(\\frac{1}{b^{a}})\n\nSince a \u2265 2, O(1/b^a) is o(1), and for b \u2265 1, it's small.\n\nSpecifically, |O(1/b^a)| < 1/2 for b large, say b \u2265 B for some B.\n\nSo for b \u2265 B, b^a + m + O(1/b^a) is between b^a + m - 0.5 and b^a + m + 0.5, say, so floor is b^a + m, as desired.\n\nBut for small b, I need to check.\n\nFor example, b=1.\n\nLeft side: floor( (1 + x)^{1/a} ) = floor( (1 + a m)^{1/a} )\n\nRight side: 1 + m\n\nNow, (1 + a m)^{1/a}, for integer m.\n\nIf m \u2265 0, 1 + a m \u2265 1, and (1 + a m)^{1/a}, since a \u2265 2, this might be less than or greater than something.\n\nWe need floor to be 1 + m.\n\nSo 1 + m \u2264 (1 + a m)^{1/a} < 2 + m\n\nSince m integer, and 1 + a m is integer, etc.\n\nFor example, let a=2, even.\n\nSo a=2, x = a m = 2m\n\nFor b=1: left side floor( sqrt(1 + 2m) )\n\nRight side 1^2 + floor(2m / 2) = 1 + floor(m) = 1 + m\n\nSo floor(sqrt(1 + 2m)) =? 1 + m\n\nNow, sqrt(1 + 2m), for integer m \u2265 0.\n\nIf m=0, x=0, sqrt(1+0)=1, floor=1, right side 1+0=1, good.\n\nIf m=1, x=2, sqrt(1+2)=sqrt(3)\u22481.732, floor=1, right side 1+1=2? 1 + m = 1+1=2, but floor is 1, not 2. Oh! Not equal.\n\n1 vs 2, not equal.\n\nSo for a=2, x=2, b=1, left side floor(sqrt(1 + 2)) = floor(sqrt(3))\u22481.732\u21921\n\nRight side 1 + floor(2/2)=1+1=2, 1\u22602.\n\nSo not equal.\n\nBut earlier for large b it was good, but for b=1 it fails.\n\nSo x cannot be multiple of a? But m can be negative? Earlier x\u2265-1, so if m=-1, x=2*(-1)= -2, but x\u2265-1? -2 < -1, not allowed. For m=0, it worked for b=1, but for other b?\n\nLet me try a=2, x=0.\n\nb=1: left floor(sqrt(1+0))=floor(1)=1, right 1 + floor(0/2)=1+0=1, good.\n\nb=2: left floor(sqrt(4 + 0) * 2^{2-1}) = floor(sqrt(4) * 2) = floor(2 * 2) = floor(4)=4\n\nRight side 2^2 + floor(0/2)=4+0=4, good.\n\nb=3: sqrt(9+0)*3 =3*3=9, floor9=9, right 9+0=9, good.\n\nSeems good for x=0.\n\nBut when I tried x=2 for a=2, it failed at b=1.\n\nWhat if x is not multiple? Perhaps x=0 is solution.\n\nBut are there others?\n\nFor a=2, x=0 works, as above.\n\nWhat about other x?\n\nSuppose for a=2, I try x=-1.\n\nx\u2265-1, so x=-1.\n\nb=1: left floor(sqrt(1 -1)) = sqrt(0)=0, floor0=0\n\nRight:1 + floor(-1/2)=1 + floor(-0.5)=1 + (-1)=0? floor(-0.5) is -1, since largest integer \u2264 -0.5 is -1.\n\nSo right side 1 + (-1) =0, left 0, good.\n\nb=2: left floor(sqrt(4 -1) * 2) = sqrt(3)*2 \u22481.732*2=3.464, floor=3\n\nRight: 4 + floor(-1/2)=4 + (-1)=3, good.\n\nb=3: sqrt(9-1)*3=sqrt(8)*3=2\u221a2 *3\u22482*1.414*3\u22488.485, floor=8\n\nRight:9 + (-1)=8, good.\n\nb=4: sqrt(16-1)*4=sqrt(15)*4\u22483.873*4\u224815.492, floor=15\n\nRight:16 + (-1)=15, good.\n\nSo for a=2, x=-1 also works.\n\nNow, are there others?\n\nWhat about x=1 for a=2.\n\nb=1: left floor(sqrt(1+1))=sqrt(2)\u22481.414, floor=1\n\nRight:1 + floor(1/2)=1+0=1, good.\n\nb=2: left floor(sqrt(4+1)*2)=sqrt(5)*2\u22482.236*2\u22484.472, floor=4\n\nRight:4 + floor(0.5)=4+0=4, good.\n\nb=3: sqrt(9+1)*3=sqrt(10)*3\u22483.162*3\u22489.486, floor=9\n\nRight:9 + floor(1/3)=9+0=9? floor(1/3)=0, yes.\n\nb=4: sqrt(16+1)*4=sqrt(17)*4\u22484.123*4\u224816.492, floor=16\n\nRight:16 + floor(1/4)=16+0=16, good.\n\nSo x=1 also works for a=2.\n\nNow what about x=0.5?\n\nb=1: left floor(sqrt(1+0.5))=sqrt(1.5)\u22481.2247, floor=1\n\nRight:1 + floor(0.5/2)=1 + floor(0.25)=1+0=1, good.\n\nb=2: left floor(sqrt(4+0.5)*2)=sqrt(4.5)*2\u22482.1213*2\u22484.2426, floor=4\n\nRight:4 + floor(0.5/2)=4 + floor(0.25)=4+0=4, good.\n\nb=3: sqrt(9+0.5)*3=sqrt(9.5)*3\u22483.0822*3\u22489.2466, floor=9\n\nRight:9 + floor(0.5/3)=9 + floor(0.166..)=9+0=9, good.\n\nb=4: sqrt(16+0.5)*4=sqrt(16.5)*4\u22484.062*4\u224816.248, floor=16\n\nRight:16 + floor(0.5/4)=16+0=16, good.\n\nSeems to work.\n\nBut earlier for x=2 it didn't work at b=1.\n\nx=2 for a=2: b=1: left floor(sqrt(1+2))=floor(sqrt3)\u22481.732\u21921, right 1 + floor(2/2)=1+1=2, 1\u22602.\n\nBut for x=0.5 it worked in these cases.\n\nBut is it working for all b? Let me try b=0, but b positive integer, so b\u22651.\n\nWhat about larger b? Say b=10 for a=2, x=0.5.\n\nLeft: sqrt(100 + 0.5)*10? The expression is floor( sqrt(b^a + x) * b^{a-1} ) for a=2, b^a=b^2, so sqrt(b^2 + x) * b^{1} , since a-1=1.\n\nSo for b=10, sqrt(100 + 0.5) * 10 = sqrt(100.5)*10 \u2248 10.02498 *10 \u2248100.2498, floor=100\n\nRight: 100 + floor(0.5 / 2)=100 + floor(0.25)=100+0=100, good.\n\nNow, is it always working? But earlier when I tried x=2, it failed at b=1.\n\nBut for x=0.5, seems ok, but let me try a value where it might fail.\n\nPerhaps for some b, the fractional part causes issue.\n\nRecall that in the expansion, we have b^a (1 + u)^{1/a} \u2248 b^a + x/a\n\nAnd we need the floor to be b^a + floor(x/a)\n\nFor this to hold, the fractional part of the expression must be less than 1, but more precisely, since it's approximately b^a + x/a, and x/a has fractional part f, so if the next terms make it less than 1, it might be ok, but in the earlier calculation for large b, the next term is negative and small, so it should be fine.\n\nBut for small b, or specific b, it might not hold.\n\nIn the case of a=2, x=0.5, it worked for b=1,2,3,4,10.\n\nBut let me try b=0, not allowed.\n\nOr b large, seems fine.\n\nBut is it true for all b?\n\nSuppose for some b, sqrt(b^2 + x) b might be close to integer.\n\nFor example, when is sqrt(b^2 + x) b close to half-integer or something.\n\nSet for a=2, left side floor( b sqrt(b^2 + x) )\n\nSince a-1=1.\n\nb sqrt(b^2 + x) = sqrt(b^4 + b^2 x)\n\nBut perhaps not helpful.\n\nNote that b sqrt(b^2 + x) = sqrt(b^4 + b^2 x)\n\nBut floor of that.\n\nThe expression b sqrt(b^2 + x) - b^2 = b ( sqrt(b^2 + x) - b ) = b \\frac{ (b^2 + x) - b^2 }{ \\sqrt{b^2 + x} + b } = b \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{b^2 + x} + b }\n\n= \\frac{b x}{ b ( \\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1 ) } = \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1 }\n\nAs b\u2192\u221e, this goes to x / (1+1) = x/2\n\nAnd we have floor( b sqrt(b^2 + x) ) = floor( b^2 + \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1 } )\n\nNow, \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1 } < \\frac{x}{1+1} = x/2 for x>0, since denominator >2? For large b, denominator \u22482, but for finite b, denominator = \\sqrt{1 + u} +1 > 2 if u>0? No, \\sqrt{1+u} < 1+u/2, so \\sqrt{1+u} +1 < 2 + u/2, but for u small, it's slightly more than 2.\n\nActually, \\sqrt{1+u} +1 > 2 for all u>0, since \\sqrt{1+u} >1 for u>0.\n\nSo denominator >2, so \\frac{x}{denom} < x/2\n\nSimilarly, for x>0, it's positive and less than x/2.\n\nSo b sqrt(b^2 + x) = b^2 + d, where 0 < d < x/2\n\nThen floor(b^2 + d) = b^2 + floor(d) if d <1, but d might be large if x large, but for fixed x, for large b, d is small.\n\nIn this case for a=2, d = \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1 } < x/2\n\nNow, the right side is b^2 + floor(x/2)\n\nNow, for the equality to hold, we need floor(b^2 + d) = b^2 + floor(x/2)\n\nSince b^2 integer, this is equivalent to floor(d) = floor(x/2)? No.\n\nfloor(b^2 + d) = b^2 + floor(d) if d \u22650, which it is for x\u22650.\n\nIs that true? Yes, since d \u22650, floor(b^2 + d) = b^2 + floor(d)\n\nThen we need b^2 + floor(d) = b^2 + floor(x/2), so floor(d) = floor(x/2)\n\nBut d = \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1 }\n\nThis depends on b, while floor(x/2) is constant.\n\nSo for this to be equal for all b, we must have that d is constant or something.\n\nSpecifically, floor(d) must be constant for all b.\n\nBut d = \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1 + x/b^2} + 1 } , as b increases, for fixed x>0, d increases to x/2.\n\nSince denominator decreases to 2 as b\u2192\u221e, so d increases to x/2.\n\nFor example, at b=1, d = \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1 + x/1} + 1 } = \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1+x} + 1 }\n\nAt b\u2192\u221e, d \u2192 x/2\n\nNow, for different b, d changes.\n\nWe need floor(d) to be equal to floor(x/2) for all b.\n\nBut as b increases, d increases from \\frac{x}{ \\sqrt{1+x} + 1 } to x/2.\n\nIf x/2 is not integer, and since d increases, floor(d) may change if d crosses an integer.\n\nBut we need it constant for all b.\n\nSo d must never cross an integer as b increases, which implies that d is constant, but it changes with b, unless x=0.\n\nBut earlier for x=0.5, let's compute d for different b.\n\nx=0.5, at b=1: d = \\frac{0.5}{ \\sqrt{1 + 0.5} + 1 } = \\frac{0.5}{ \\sqrt{1.5} + 1 } \u2248 0.5 / (1.2247 + 1) \u2248 0.5 / 2.2247 \u2248 0.2248\n\nfloor(d) = floor(0.2248) = 0\n\nfloor(x/2) = floor(0.25) = 0\n\nAt b=2: d = \\frac{0.5}{ \\sqrt{1 + 0.5/4} + 1 } = \\frac{0.5}{ \\sqrt{1 + 0.125} + 1 } = \\frac{0.5}{ \\sqrt{1.125} + 1 } \u2248 0.5 / (1.0607 + 1) \u2248 0.5 / 2.0607 \u2248 0.2426\n\nfloor=0\n\nAt b\u2192\u221e, d\u21920.5/2=0.25, floor=0\n\nNow, is there a b where d\u22651?

Moreover, the equation must hold for other \\(b\\), leading to the condition that \\(r\\) must be such that the expression remains consistent.\n\nHowever, further testing for \\(a=2\\) showed that \\(x\\) in intervals \\([-1,0)\\) and \\([0,2)\\) work, but not \\([3,4)\\) because for \\(x=3\\), \\(b=1\\): left side is \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{4} \\rfloor = 2\\), right side is \\(1 + \\lfloor 1.5 \\rfloor = 1 + 1 = 2\\), but for \\(b=2\\), left side is \\(\\lfloor 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{4+3} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2\\sqrt{7} \\rfloor \\approx \\lfloor 2 \\cdot 2.64575 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 5.2915 \\rfloor = 5\\), right side is \\(4 + \\lfloor 3/2 \\rfloor = 4 + 1 = 5\\), and for \\(b=3\\), left side \\(\\lfloor 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{9+3} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3\\sqrt{12} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 6\\sqrt{3} \\rfloor \\approx \\lfloor 10.392 \\rfloor = 10\\), right side \\(9 + 1 = 10\\). So \\(x=3\\) works for \\(a=2\\). Similarly, \\(x=-1,0,0.5,1,1.5,3\\) all work for \\(a=2\\). \n\nBut earlier for \\(x=2\\) with \\(a=2\\), it failed at \\(b=1\\). So what is common? For \\(a=2\\), the values that work are \\(x \\in [-1,0) \\cup [0,2) \\setminus \\{2\\}\\), but 2 is excluded. However, \\([0,2)\\) includes numbers up to but not including 2, and \\([-1,0)\\) is separate. But \\(x=3\\) is outside, and it worked. So perhaps for each \\(d\\), \\(x\\) in \\([a d + c_d, a d + c_d' )\\) for some constants.\n\nFrom the \\(b=1\\) condition: \\( (1+d)^a \\leq 1+x < (2+d)^a \\) and \\(a d \\leq x < a(d+1)\\). The intersection must be non-empty. For example, with \\(a=2\\), \\(d=1\\): \\(a d = 2\\), \\(a(d+1)=4\\), and from \\(b=1\\): \\((2)^2 = 4 \\leq 1+x < (3)^2=9\\), so \\(3 \\leq x <8\\), but combined with \\(2 \\leq x <4\\), so \\(3 \\leq x <4\\). Similarly for \\(d=0\\): \\(0 \\leq x <2\\), and \\(1 \\leq 1+x <4\\), so \\(0 \\leq x <3\\), intersection [0,2). For \\(d=-1\\): \\(-2 \\leq x <0\\), and \\(0 \\leq 1+x <1\\), so \\(-1 \\leq x <0\\). For \\(d=1\\), \\(x \\in [3,4)\\). We also need to verify for other b.\n\nWhen we tested for \\(a=2\\) and \\(x=3\\) (which is in [3,4)), it worked for b=1,2,3. Similarly, \\(x=3.5\\): b=1: left \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{1+3.5} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt{4.5} \\rfloor \\approx \\lfloor 2.121 \\rfloor =2\\), right \\(1 + \\lfloor 3.5/2 \\rfloor =1 + \\lfloor 1.75 \\rfloor =1+1=2\\). b=2: left \\(\\lfloor 2 \\sqrt{4+3.5} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2\\sqrt{7.5} \\rfloor \\approx \\lfloor 2 \\cdot 2.738 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 5.476 \\rfloor =5\\), right \\(4 + \\lfloor 3.5/2 \\rfloor =4+1=5\\). b=3: left \\(\\lfloor 3 \\sqrt{9+3.5} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3\\sqrt{12.5} \\rfloor \\approx \\lfloor 3 \\cdot 3.5355 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 10.6065 \\rfloor =10\\), right \\(9 + \\lfloor 3.5/2 \\rfloor =9+1=10\\). Good.\n\nNow for \\(x=2\\) with a=2, which corresponds to d=1 since floor(2/2)=1, but from b=1 condition, x should be in [3,4) for d=1, but x=2 is not, and it failed. For d=0, x<2, so 2 is excluded.\n\nSo perhaps the condition from b=1 is sufficient? But we need to ensure it holds for all b.\n\nTry a=2, x=3.99, d=floor(3.99/2)=1, since 1.995, floor is 1. From b=1: (1+1)^2=4 \u2264 1+3.99=4.99? 4\u22644.99<9, yes. Left floor(sqrt(1+3.99))=floor(sqrt(4.99))\u2248floor(2.234)=2, right 1+1=2, good. b=2: left floor(2 * sqrt(4+3.99))=floor(2*sqrt(7.99))\u2248floor(2*2.8267)\u2248floor(5.6534)=5, right 4 + floor(3.99/2)=4 + floor(1.995)=4+1=5, good. b=3: left floor(3*sqrt(9+3.99))=floor(3*sqrt(12.99))\u2248floor(3*3.604)=floor(10.812)=10, right 9 +1=10, good.\n\nNow for b where it might fail, say b=10: left floor(10 * sqrt(100+3.99))=floor(10*sqrt(103.99))\u2248floor(10*10.197)=floor(101.97)=101, right 100 + floor(3.99/2)=100 +1=101, good.\n\nNow what about x just below 3, say x=2.999 for a=2. d=floor(2.999/2)=floor(1.4995)=1. But for b=1: (1+d)^a=(2)^2=4 \u2264 1+x=3.999? 4 \u2264 3.999? No! 4 > 3.999, so fails the b=1 condition. Indeed, left floor(sqrt(1+2.999))=floor(sqrt(3.999))\u2248floor(1.99975)=1, right 1+1=2, not equal. So only when the b=1 condition is satisfied.\n\nFor x in [3,4) it works, but for x<3, if d=1, it fails b=1.\n\nSimilarly, for x= -0.5, a=2, d=floor(-0.5/2)=floor(-0.25)= -1. b=1: left floor(sqrt(1-0.5))=floor(sqrt(0.5))\u2248floor(0.707)=0, right 1 + (-1)=0, good. b=2: left floor(2*sqrt(4-0.5))=floor(2*sqrt(3.5))\u2248floor(2*1.8708)=floor(3.7416)=3, right 4 + (-1)=3, good. So works.\n\nNow, is the condition from b=1 sufficient for all b? For a=2, x in [-1,0) or [0,2) or [3,4), and we need to check if for all b the equation holds.\n\nFor example, a=2, x=3.5, b=100: left floor(100 * sqrt(10000 + 3.5)) = floor(100 * sqrt(10003.5)) \u2248 floor(100 * 100.0175) = floor(10001.75) = 10001, right 10000 + floor(3.5/2) = 10000 + 1 = 10001, good.\n\nBut is there a case where b=1 is satisfied but for some larger b it fails? Suppose for a=4, and some x.\n\nFirst, for a=4, which is even.\n\nb=1: floor( (1+x)^{1/4} ) = 1 + d, with d=floor(x/4)\n\nSo (1+d)^4 \u2264 1+x < (2+d)^4\n\nAnd a d \u2264 x < a(d+1) i.e. 4d \u2264 x < 4d+4\n\nFor d=0: (1+0)^4=1 \u2264 1+x < 16, and 0\u2264x<4, so 0\u2264x<4\n\nFor d=1: 16 \u2264 1+x < 81, and 4\u2264x<8, so 15\u2264x<8? 16\u22641+x implies x\u226515, but x<8, contradiction. So d\u22651 not possible for a=4? But d can be negative.\n\nd=-1: (-1+1)^4=0 \u22641+x, so x\u2265-1, and (2-1)^4=1, so 1+x<1, x<0. Also a d = -4 \u2264 x <0, so intersection -1\u2264x<0? From 0 \u22641+x<1, so -1\u2264x<0.\n\nNow, is there x in [0,4) for d=0. Test x=0: b=1: left floor((1+0)^{1/4})=floor(1)=1, right 1 + floor(0/4)=1+0=1, good.\n\nx=2: b=1: left floor((3)^{1/4}) \u2248 floor(1.316)=1, right 1+0=1, good.\n\nNow for b=2: left floor( \\sqrt[4]{16 + 2} \\cdot 2^{3} ) = floor( \\sqrt[4]{18} \\cdot 8 )\n\n\\sqrt[4]{18} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{18}} = \\sqrt{3\\sqrt{2}} \u2248 \\sqrt{3*1.414} \u2248 \\sqrt{4.242} \u2248 2.059, times 8 \u2248 16.472, floor=16\n\nRight: 16 + floor(2/4)=16 + floor(0.5)=16+0=16, good.\n\nx=3.9: b=1: left floor((4.9)^{1/4}) \u2248 floor( \\sqrt[4]{4.9} ) \u2248 \\sqrt{\\sqrt{4.9}} \u2248 \\sqrt{2.2136} \u2248 1.488, floor=1, right 1+ floor(3.9/4)=1+0=1, good.\n\nb=2: \\sqrt[4]{16+3.9}=\\sqrt[4]{19.9} \u2248 \\sqrt[4]{20} \u2248 \\sqrt{4.472} \u2248 2.115, times 8 \u2248 16.92, floor=16, right 16 +0=16, good.\n\nNow try d=1 for a=4, but earlier b=1 condition is 16 \u22641+x<81 and 4\u2264x<8, so x\u226515, but 15>8, contradiction, so no solution for d=1.\n\nSimilarly d=2: b=1: (1+2)^4=81\u22641+x<256, and 8\u2264x<12, so 80\u2264x<12? impossible.\n\nd=-2: a d=-8\u2264x<-4, b=1: (1-2)^4=1 \u22641+x, x\u22650, contradiction.\n\nSo for a=4, possible x in [-1,0) or [0,4).\n\nBut earlier for a=2, we had [3,4) for d=1. For a=4, why no such interval?\n\nFor a=4, d=0: x in [0,4)\n\nd=1 would require x\u226515 but x<8, impossible.\n\nBut is there x not covered? For example x=15, but a=4, b=1: (1+d)^4 for d=floor(15/4)=3, since 15/4=3.75, floor=3. Then (1+3)^4=256 \u22641+15=16? 256\u226416 false. Left floor((16)^{1/4})=2, right 1 + floor(15/4)=1+3=4, not equal.\n\nx=5, d=floor(5/4)=1, b=1: (1+1)^4=16 \u22641+5=6? false.\n\nSo only [-1,0) and [0,4) for a=4.\n\nBut for a=2, we have additional [3,4) for d=1.\n\nThe difference is that for larger d, when (1+d)^a is not too large, it might work if (1+d)^a \u2264 a d + r +1 for r< a, but in a=2, (1+1)^2=4, and a d + max r =2+2=4, and 4\u22641+x<4 is impossible, but for x\u22653, 1+x\u22654, so equality holds when x=3? But for x=3,1+x=4, (1+d)^a=4, so 4\u22644<9, satisfied.\n\nFor a=4, (1+d)^4 for d=1 is 16, while a d + r < 4+4=8<16, so no overlap.\n\nGeneralizing, for given a even, and d integer, the b=1 condition is:\n\\[\n(1 + d)^a \\leq 1 + x < (2 + d)^a\n\\]\nand from d = floor(x/a), \n\\[\na d \\leq x < a(d+1)\n\\]\nCombining:\n\\[\n\\max\\left( (1 + d)^a - 1, a d \\right) \\leq x < \\min\\left( (2 + d)^a - 1, a(d+1) \\right)\n\\]\nFor this interval to be non-empty, we need \n\\[\n\\max\\left( (1 + d)^a - 1, a d \\right) < \\min\\left( (2 + d)^a - 1, a(d+1) \\right)\n\\]\nMoreover, for the equation to hold for all b, it turns out that this condition is sufficient. In the cases tested, when this is satisfied, it worked for other b. Also, for x in these intervals, the fractional part and the expansion suggest it should work.\n\nNow, we need to find all integers d such that the interval is non-empty.\n\nFirst, d must satisfy x \u2265 -1, and since a d \u2264 x < a(d+1), d can be negative.\n\nNow, for each d, compute the bounds.\n\nNote that a d \u2264 x < a d + a, and (1+d)^a \u2264 1 + x < (2+d)^a\n\nSo 1 + x \u2265 (1+d)^a implies x \u2265 (1+d)^a - 1\n\nAnd x < (2+d)^a - 1\n\nAlso x \u2265 a d, x < a d + a\n\nSo x \u2265 max( a d, (1+d)^a - 1 )\n\nx < min( a d + a, (2+d)^a - 1 )\n\nThe interval is non-empty if max( a d, (1+d)^a - 1 ) < min( a d + a, (2+d)^a - 1 )\n\nNow, for various d, we can compute.\n\nSince a is even and \u22652, we can find for which d this holds.\n\nNote that for large |d|, it may not hold, but since x \u2265 -1, and a fixed, we can compute for d near 0.\n\nFor example, d = -1:\nmax( a*(-1), (1-1)^a - 1 ) = max( -a, 0 - 1 ) = max(-a, -1)\nSince a \u22652, -a \u2264 -2 < -1, so max is -1\nmin( a(-1) + a, (2-1)^a -1 ) = min(0, 1 -1) = min(0,0)=0\nSo -1 \u2264 x < 0, which is [-1,0)\n\nFor d=0:\nmax( a*0, 1^a -1 ) = max(0, 1-1)=max(0,0)=0\nmin(0 + a, 2^a -1) = min(a, 2^a -1)\nSince a \u22652, 2^a -1 \u2265 3, and a may be less or more, but min(a, 2^a -1) = a since for a\u22652, a \u2264 2^a -1? a=2: min(2,4-1=3)=2; a=4: min(4,16-1=15)=4; yes, since 2^a -1 \u22653>2 for a\u22652? a=2, 3>2 yes; a=1 not considered. So min is a.\nSo 0 \u2264 x < a\n\nFor d=1:\nmax( a*1, (2)^a -1 ) = max(a, 2^a -1)\nmin( a + a, (3)^a -1 ) = min(2a, 3^a -1)\nNow max(a, 2^a -1) = 2^a -1 since for a\u22652, 2^a -1 \u22653>2\u2265a? a\u22652, 2^a -1: a=2,3; a=3,7; a=4,15, all >a for a\u22652? a=2,3>2; a=3,7>3; yes.\nmin(2a, 3^a -1): 3^a -1 grows faster, so for a=2, min(4, 9-1=8)=4\nThen max=3, min=4, so 3 \u2264 x <4? For a=2: 3\u2264x<4\nFor a=4, max(a,2^a-1)=max(4,15)=15; min(8,81-1=80)=8; 15<8? No, 15>8, empty.\nSimilarly for a=3, but a even, so a\u22652.\n\nFor d=2:\nmax(a*2, (3)^a -1) = max(2a, 3^a -1)\nmin(3a, 4^a -1)\nFor a=2: max(4,9-1=8)=8; min(6,16-1=15)=6; 8<6? No.\na=4: max(8,81-1=80)=80; min(12,256-1=255)=12; 80>12, no.\n\nFor d=-2:\nmax(a*(-2), (1-2)^a -1 ) = max(-2a, (-1)^a -1)\nSince a even, (-1)^a =1, so 1-1=0\nSo max(-2a,0) =0 (since -2a<0)\nmin(a*(-2)+a, (2-2)^a -1) = min(-a, 0 -1) = min(-a,-1)\nSince a\u22652, -a\u2264-2, min is -a\nThen 0 \u2264 x < -a? But -a<0, not possible. Also x\u2265-1>-a for a\u22652? But 0 \u2264 x and x< -a \u2264 -2 <0, contradiction. So no solution for d\u2264-2.\n\nd=0,-1 are covered.\n\nBut for a=2, d=1 gave [3,4). For larger a, if a=4, d=1 not possible, but what about other d? d=0 and d=-1 only.\n\nBut for example a=4, x=15, we saw not work. Is there x outside [0,4)\u222a[-1,0)? Say x=5, d=floor(5/4)=1, b=1: (1+1)^4=16 \u22641+5=6? False.

Impossible.\n\nSo again only [-1,0) and [0,a).\n\nBut for a=2, we had an extra interval [3,4) which is for d=1.\n\nNotice that for d=1, a=2: max(a d, (1+d)^a -1)=max(2,4-1=3)=3; min(4,9-1=8)=4, so [3,4)\n\nFor a=4, d=1: max(4,16-1=15)=15; min(8,81-1=80)=8; 15<8?

False. Left floor(sqrt5)\u22482.236\u21922, right 1+2=3, 2\u22603.\n\nx=2.5? d=floor(2.5/2)=1? But for d=1, should be in [3,4), but 2.5<3. For d=0? x=2.5 not in [0,2). So not in any. b=1: left floor(sqrt(1+2.5))=floor(sqrt3.5)\u22481.87\u21921, right 1+1=2? d=floor(2.5/2)=floor(1.25)=1, yes, 1\u22602. Fails.\n\nNow for a=4, say x=3.9 in [0,4), works as before.\n\nx= -0.5 in [-1,0), works.\n\nx=4? Not in. d=floor(4/4)=1, but for d=1, interval empty, and b=1: (2)^4=16\u22641+4=5? False. Left floor(5^{1/4})\u22481.495\u21921, right 1+1=2, fails.\n\nSo the solution seems to be the union over integers d of the intervals defined by the max and min above.\n\nBut for each a, we find d such that the interval is non-empty.\n\nSpecifically, for a given even positive integer a:\n\n- For d = -1: x in [-1, 0)\n- For d = 0: x in [0, a)\n- For a = 2 and d = 1: x in [3, 4)  [only for a=2]\n\nBut are there other d for other a? For example a=6, is there d?\n\nd=1 not work, d=2 not, but what about d= -3, -2, etc, no.\n\nOr d=0, -1 only.\n\nBut for a=2, we have extra.\n\nNow, generalize: when does d=1 work? When max(a*1, (1+1)^a -1) < min(2a, 3^a -1)\n\nmax(a, 2^a -1) = 2^a -1 since for a\u22652, 2^a -1 > a as a\u22652.\n\nmin(2a, 3^a -1) = 2a if 2a \u2264 3^a -1, which for a=2: 4 \u2264 9-1=8, yes; a=3:6\u226426? yes, but a even; a=4:8\u226480? yes; but for a=4, we have 2^a -1=15, min=8, 15<8? False. Similarly, only when 2^a -1 < 2a? 2^a -1 < 2a?\n\nFor a=2: 4-1=3 < 4? 3<4 yes.\n\na=3:8-1=7<6? 7<6 no.\n\na=4:15<8? no.\n\na=1:1<2? but a even.\n\nSo only for a=2, 2^a -1 =3 < 4=2a.\n\nAnd min is min(4,8)=4 for a=2.\n\nSo only a=2 has d=1.\n\nFor other d? For example d=2 for a=2: max(4,9-1=8)=8; min(6,16-1=15)=6; 8<6? no.\n\nd=3: max(6,16-1=15)=15; min(8,25-1=24)=8; 15<8? no.\n\nd=-1 and d=0 as before.\n\nSo for a=2, d=1 is extra.\n\nSimilarly, for a>2, no.\n\nBut is there d for larger a? For example a=4, d= something else.\n\nSuppose d=0, -1 as above.\n\nd=1 not work.\n\nd=3: for a=4, max(12, 4^4 -1=256-1=255)=255; min(16,5^4-1=625-1=624)=16; 255<16? no.\n\nd=-3: max(-12, (1-3)^4 -1=16-1=15)=15; min(-12+4=-8, (2-3)^4 -1=1-1=0)=min(-8,0)= -8; 15\u2264x<-8? no.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, in general, for each even positive integer a, the solution set is:\n\n- x in [-1, 0) for d = -1\n- x in [0, a) for d = 0\n- and additionally, only for a = 2, x in [3, 4)\n\nBut for a=2, [3,4) is extra.\n\nTo write nicely.\n\nNotice that for a=2, [3,4) corresponds to x in [3,4), which is not covered by [-1,0) or [0,2).\n\nWe can write the intervals.\n\nBut in all cases, the set is a union of half-open intervals.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFor any even positive integer a, the solution includes x in [-1, 0) and x in [0, a).\n\nFor a = 2, additionally x in [3, 4).\n\nTo confirm with another a, say a=6.\n\nSolution should be [-1,0) \u222a [0,6)\n\nTest x=5: d=floor(5/6)=0? 5/6\u22480.833, floor=0.\n\nb=1: left floor( (1+5)^{1/6} ) = floor(6^{1/6}) \u2248 floor(1.348) =1? 6^{1/6}, since 1.2^6=2.985, 1.3^6=4.826, 1.4^6=7.529, so \u22481.348, floor=1.\n\nBut right side b^a + d =1^6 + floor(5/6)=1+0=1, good? Left is 1, right is 1, good.\n\nNow for",
