                        Hello everyone!
                        I'm Alex Avdiushenko, and I am happy to have a talk here.
                        Today I suggest discussing the vibe coding with Junie.
                        Junie helped me to create a web app for fitness.
                        It's a great way to learn how to code and how to improve your coding skills.

                            Let me walk you through our journey today. We'll follow five simple steps.
                            First, we need a spark of inspiration - something that excites us.
                            <br>
                            Then, we'll use GPT-5 to craft the perfect instructions for our AI coding agent.
                            <br>
                            Next comes a bit of the magic - we let Junie do the heavy lifting and build our app.
                            <br>
                            Of course, no code is perfect on the first try, so we'll debug a bit.
                            <br>
                            And finally, while we might not make millions yet, we'll gain something even better -
                            the satisfaction of creating something real and useful!

                            Before we dive in, let's watch (maybe watch again) this quick video
                            that demonstrates what we're about to create.
                            Pay attention to how the technology can transform a simple idea into a working application.

                            Step one is all about finding your passion project. Start with something you genuinely enjoy -
                            maybe you love running, playing guitar, or doodling during meetings.
                            <br>
                            Then ask yourself: how could technology make this activity better or more engaging?
                            <br>
                            It's crucial to do your homework here. Look at what already exists in the market.
                            As you can see on the screen, there are apps like Agit and TrainFit
                            that tackle fitness tracking.
                            Study these solutions - what do they do well? What's missing?
                            This research helps you
                            find your unique angle and perspective on how to prompt AI.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            And here is the second step.
                            Now here's where things get interesting. We're not going to write code ourselves
                            just yet or even long texts.
                            Instead, we'll use GPT-5 as our prompt engineer. Think of this as writing a detailed 
                            specification for another AI. You describe your vision, the features you want, 
                            the user experience you're imagining - and GPT-5 helps you craft this into a 
                            comprehensive, technical prompt that coding agent Junie can understand and execute.
                            This step is critical because a well-crafted prompt means better results
                            from your coding agent.

                                Let's go on. Here's where the magic happens!
                                We hand over our carefully crafted prompt to Junie.
                                And then we are simple watching as Junie breaks down the problem,
                                plans the architecture, and starts generating code.
                                <br>
                                In the first image, you see Junie analyzing the requirements.
                                <br>
                                In the second, it's already building out the project structure and
                                writing actual code.
                                This is vibe-coding - you're guiding the direction while the AI handles
                                the heavy implementation details.
                                It's collaborative creation between human and AI.

                                Now let's be real - AI isn't perfect, any AI, and that's okay!
                                This is the step about the debugging phase.
                                <br>
                                First, I asked Junie to improve the documentation by updating the README.
                                Good documentation is essential for any project.
                                <br>
                                Then, we hit a classic dependency issue -
                                it was a missing React plugin. Sometimes you need to roll up your sleeves
                                and fix things manually. That's part of the process.
                                <br>
                                Finally, I noticed Junie hadn't implemented tests or
                                camera functionality yet. These are critical features for our fitness app.
                                <br>
                                The key lesson here: AI is a powerful assistant, but you still need to be
                                both the project manager and the software developer,
                                catching gaps and guiding the next steps.

                                And here's our first working prototype! Look at this simple interface.
                                On the left, you see the main screen - minimalist and focused.
                                On the right, we have the exercise tracking view page, without any visuals yet.
                                <br>
                                This is the beauty of vibe coding - you can go from idea to working prototype
                                incredibly quickly. Now we have something tangible to test, to show users,
                                to iterate on. Remember, perfect is the enemy of good. This functional prototype
                                is far more valuable than a perfectly planned app that doesn't exist yet.

                                To be honest, I didn't force Junie to implement these two last milestones M3 and M4.
                                The main reason was that I wanted to keep the project simple and didn't deploy it anywhere.
                                <br>
                                But breaking projects into milestones like this keeps everything organized and achievable.
                                You're not trying to build everything at once - you're making steady, measurable progress
                                together with AI.

                                Now let's zoom in on the Milestone 2, the heart of our fitness app.
                                Here Junie is implementing three critical components working together.
                                <br>
                                First, client-side pose detection - this means the app analyzes your body position
                                right in your browser, no server needed. Privacy-first design!
                                <br>
                                Second, real-time repetition counting - the app actually tracks your squats or push-ups
                                as you do them. And the user interface that brings it all together.
                                You can see in this screenshot how Junie is methodically implementing each piece.

                                Sometimes Junie even asks questions

                                Here's something I really appreciate about Junie - it doesn't just blindly follow orders.
                                When it's uncertain or when there are multiple valid approaches, Junie may ask questions.
                                This IS intelligent behavior, isn't it!
                                It's asking for clarification to make better decisions.
                                <br>
                                Should we use this library or that one? What's the preferred styling approach?
                                How do we want to handle edge cases? This collaborative dialogue is what makes
                                vibe coding so effective. You're not just a user giving commands - you're a partner
                                in the development process.
                                The AI respects your judgment and seeks your input
                                when it matters.

                                Before we jump into the demo, let me point out something interesting -
                                see this pointer feature in the presentation? That was also created by Junie!
                                It's a perfect example of how AI can help with both the main project and the tools we
                                use.
                                <br>
                                And now for the moment of truth - the live demonstration!
                                I encourage you all to check out the GitHub repository after this presentation or now.
                                You can see the full source code, read the documentation, and even try it yourself.
                                The beauty of this approach is transparency - everything we built is open and accessible.
                                <br>
                                And also I will be really happy to discuss this project or anything else on LinkedIn
                                or in Telegram. Feel free to reach out.
                                <br>
                                I hope you enjoyed this talk and learned something new.
