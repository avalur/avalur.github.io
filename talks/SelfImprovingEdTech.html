						We start with the example of CHEGG company, which focused on improving learning
						and learning outcomes for students. This company, as many others,
						was hit hard by the launch of ChatGPT.
						<br>
						In May 2023, the company said, “In the FIRST PART of the year,
						we saw no noticeable impact from ChatGPT on our new account growth, and
						we were meeting expectations on new sign-ups.”

						Now let me share my own workflow for teaching and lecture preparation.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, I usually work in PyCharm complemented with the TeXiFy IDEA plugin.
						This combination brings together LaTeX, Python, and JavaScript all in one place.
						It allows using powerful autocompletion and inspections of PyCharm,
						and inverse search from pdf.
						<br>
						NEXT, let's discuss the AI Assistant.
						It is capable of assisting with translations in a broader sense.
						AI helper is not just restricted to translating languages;
						it can convert formats, elaborate short ideas into detailed descriptions,
						and even to oral speech, facilitate auto tests creation, and more.
						<br>
						THIRDLY, I'm using the GitHub Copilot plugin.
						It offers practical pieces of code,
						draft solutions, and generally helps speed up the writing of text content
						for my lectures and other materials.
						<br>
						LAST but not least, the Grazie plugin checks for typos and polishes long sentences.
						Its purpose is to ensure your text is clean, concise, and clear before reaching your audience.

					<img src="images/problem_to_IMC2024.gif" alt="problem_to_IMC2024.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here I'd like to show the concrete example from my own experience. It is producing
						the problem for the International Mathematical Competition.
						<br>
						First of all, I have chosen an appropriate problem from ancient times of my teaching
						at Novosibirsk State University. There I organized math contests with tricky olimpiad tasks.
						So I need to translate the problem from Russian to English and
						to make a Latex format from Microsoft Word.
						<br>
						You see, with the help of AI assistant; I can do it in a few seconds.
						Here I simply copy-paste the answer to the working area.
						Then I check the result and look at the Grazie suggestions.
						Here I don't accept it, because it suggests something strange
						about additional dot in the text after the word "elements",
						but often it helps to polish the text.
						<br>
						Then I compile Tex sources and look at PDF file.
						<br>
						Then I need to write a solution, so I think through the solution and type it in Latex format.
						So firstly, I write x^2 = 0, then latex Rightarrow command goes.
						Here you can see that GitHub Copilot helps me to write the solution very quickly;
						it even makes simple calculation with math formulas.
						<br>
						Then I write the second part of the solution. Here I need to prove that
						the product being equal to zero is commutative. So that ab=0 if and only if ba=0.
						You see, sometimes I disagree with the Copilot's suggestions, but often it helps.
						Eventually, I check everything, recompile Tex sources and get the final PDF file done.
						Really fast, effective and convenient workflow, at least for me.
						Maybe you will consider using something similar for your own practice.

					<aside class="notes">
						And of course, students master new technologies just as well as
						teachers or even better.
						<br>
						Consider two typical examples from students of our educational program in Cyprus.
						NADEZHDA with her friends had one exam in the format of solving practical cases.
						They had to prepare using only two task samples from the teacher.
						So they added the theory from the slides of all the lectures into the GPT,
						followed it with exam samples. And asked AI to generate
						similar task-samples based on the received theory.
						It was a superfast preparation for this kind of exam!
						<br>
						Let's look at another example from YAROSLAV.
						He was given some task to write some kind of convolutional neural network.
						Initially, when looking at such a task, it is not always clear how to approach
						it and where to start. In the past, Google solved this, helping with existing solutions
						and showing how related tasks are done.
						<br>
						Now ChatGPT just writes the first version of code.
						Usually, approximately 20% of this code remains in the final version of neural network;
						and sometimes it even writes completely inadequate code, which, however,
						helps to understand what to Google next.
						In the following process of execution, Yaroslav uses ChatGPT as a bug fixer.

						Let's go on to a few observations about modern education from our teachers.
						<br><br>
						They NOTED the incredible speed of learning today.
						Essentially, as soon as new knowledge emerges,
						it becomes almost immediately available to everyone.
						This speed makes a significant impact.
						<br>
						For instance, IMAGINE we discover something on Twitter today.
						By tomorrow, we've already added a new skill to our repertoire.
						In just a week, all of our students have acquired this skill.
						<br>
						That's why the CRUCIAL skill nowadays becomes the ability to solve unsolved problems.
						<br>
						ALSO our teachers highlighted certain essential activities
						for the development of critical thinking.
						<br>
						Those activities include crafting mathematical PROOFS and checking them,
						<br>
						DEBUGGING problems in code or systems,
						<br>
						tasks related to system ENGINEERING, including robotics,
						<br>
						and, importantly, you have to engage in HUMAN discussions and debates.

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now let’s talk about how technology plays a key role
						in creating self-improving educational content.

						First, we have AI-powered tools that continuously generate, refine,
						and improve educational content. These tools can act like ChatGPT-style assistants,
						capable of providing clear explanations or generating new examples
						to simplify complex or challenging topics for students.
						This ensures that the content stays fresh, adaptive, and accessible for every learner.

						Next, multimodal learning focuses on delivering education through various channels like text,
						videos, interactive simulations, or even virtual and augmented reality.
						For instance, imagine teaching a physics concept — some students might prefer reading about it,
						others might benefit from a video demonstration, and for some,
						an interactive AR experiment could make the concept click.
						The idea is to adapt to different learning styles for maximum impact.

						Lastly, we bring in gamification. Features like levels,
						and challenges will keep students engaged and motivated.
						For example, when a student masters a topic, they might earn a badge,
						which then unlocks new, more advanced challenges tailored to their progress.
						It turns learning into a rewarding and fun experience.

						These three elements—AI-driven content, multimodal learning,
						and gamification — are the building blocks for creating an adaptive,
						engaging, and future-ready educational system.

						Now, as we reach the final of the presentation, I'd like to leave you with some takeaways.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, the panorama of reliable information sources has evolved over the centuries.
						Yet one constant remains — the need for strong education and critical thinking.
 						In today's fast-paced world, this need is not just constant but has become more crucial than ever.
						<br>
						SECONDLY, the incredible speed at which information is now accessible presents us
						with new opportunities.
						It allows for rapid learning, immediate access to knowledge,
						and the ability to connect globally.
						However, it also demands from us a strong sense of discernment and responsibility.
						<br>
						As a COMPANY, addressing these changes means adapting and innovating.
						We already have 'JetBrains AI assistant', integrated across all the products,
						improving our workflows and decision-making processes.
						<br>
						FINALLY, we don't just adapt but lead.
						We have the opportunity to be pioneers in deep integration
						of AI into software development and education tools,
						both online and offline.
						By doing this, we can shape a smarter, more efficient working and learning environment.
						<br>
						So, I invite you to JOIN us in studying and
						in development new learning environment; it's really fun and exciting.
						<br>
						Your thoughts, FEEDBACK, and ideas are invaluable.
						I encourage you to connect with me on Telegram or GitHub.
						Let's collaborate and shape the future of education together.
						Thank you very much for you attention.
