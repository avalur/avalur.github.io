“What is the most important thing a scientist should cultivate in himself? One should get rid of excessive ambition. One should not think that only a genius can be happy. One must learn to appreciate even a small achievement, to rejoice in it, and never overestimate oneself. One has to cultivate a love for work. One has to understand and cultivate the joy of learning, which is almost the same as the joy of life. Happiness is when your life’s work is needed.” 
Sobolev, Sergei Lvovich

Foreword and acknowledgments
Its use is not just that History may give everyone his due 
and that others may look forward to similar praise, but 
also that the art of discovery be promoted and its meth 
ods known through illustrious examples.  
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 
Historia et origo calculi differentialis. 
. Mathematicians of the past, in general, experienced similar worries as we do. How to choose a research problem? Where to find a job? How to deal with administrative responsibilities? What to do in times of political instability, epidemics, famine, and war? 
We take the reader through a book of answers to these questions, given by the mathematicians of the past — we learn what they did in a given situation, and how it turned out. Their biographies set a broader perspective; they allow us to see how the same aspirations play out differently in various historical periods. 
This is the first way to read our book: the biographical notes, which make up half of the book, convey the life experiences of our colleagues from the past. 
. The reformist tsar Peter the Great wished to organize the education system in Russia in a European manner. Influenced (among others) by Leibniz, he created the Academy of Sciences and Arts in St. Petersburg. Peter the Great commissioned Blumentrost, his physician-in-ordinary (!), to find future col laborators in Europe. 
Peter the Great passed away, but the Academy opened in  under Em press Catherine I. To build science from scratch came several relatively young people, averaging about , including nineteen-year-old Euler, Russia’s great est mathematical fortune. Leonhard Euler found interesting mathematics in everything, be it cartography, blood circulation, or the study of the stability of ships. Among the early academicians were Christian Goldbach — who sparked Euler’s interest in number theory and later worked as a cryptographer — and Daniel Bernoulli, who wrote in St. Petersburg his textbook on fluid dynamics,

 Foreword and acknowledgments 
one of the great achievements of eighteenth-century science, and popularized the Petersburg paradox. 
Mathematical education in Russia received a strong impetus: schools and universities were established, textbooks were translated over the following decades. Euler’s works were published for another  years after his death. 
. The next significant stage was marked by the mathematicians Bunyakov sky, Ostrogradsky, and Lam´e. All of them were educated in Europe and made notable contributions to education in Russia. Like Euler, they did not shy away from any work: in addition to mathematics, Bunyakovsky worked in demography (for example, he used statistics to determine the size of the Russian army), Lam´e calculated stresses for the domes and arches of St. Isaac’s Cathedral, Ostrogradsky developed statistical methods for dealing with rejects in production and studied the theoretical issues of ballistics. 
. The next stroke of luck was Chebyshev, not much inferior to Euler in the breadth of his interests. Chebyshev frequently traveled to Western Europe to discuss mathematics, and then raised a whole galaxy of students so that there was someone to talk to in Russia. 
The older the school, the more valuable it is. For a school is a total ity of centuries of accumulated creative techniques, traditions, and oral histories about scientists who have gone or are now living, their way of working, and their views on the subject of research. These oral traditions, which accumulate over the centuries and cannot be printed or communi cated to those considered to be unsuitable — these oral traditions are a treasure whose effectiveness is difficult even to imagine and evaluate... Looking for any parallels or comparisons, the age of a school, its accumu lation of traditions and legends, is nothing other than the energy of the school, in an implicit form.

. Then came the First World War, a time of upheaval. Near the end of the war, there came two revolutions. During a famine in St. Petersburg (then called Petrograd), the Sochocki family died of hunger and cold; Steklov and Krylov miraculously survived, while younger Vinogradov, Friedmann, and Besicovitch had moved to university in Perm, which kept changing hands during the civil war — but at least they were fed there! 
Besicovitch and Tamarkin emigrated, fearing the new authorities, and the Steklov Institute, headed by Vinogradov, moved to Moscow. Many mathemati cians died or left (some abroad, some to Moscow), but mathematical life in St. Petersburg (now Leningrad) did not stop: students matured — Linnik, Kan torovich, Alexandrov, Sobolev, Fock, Faddeev... and then the Second World War began.
Foreword and acknowledgments  
After the war, Leningrad served as a place for people with “wrong” biogra phies (such as Rokhlin and Ladyzhenskaya), who had no place in Moscow. And once again, a large constellation of mathematicians emerged who have left their mark on world science. 
. In this book we write about mathematicians who lived or worked in St. Pe tersburg, including, for example, Georg Cantor, who was born in the city. An interesting coincidence: Cantor was baptized in the same Lutheran church where Euler was married. Chebyshev lived in the same house on Vasilevskiy Is land where Cantor’s childhood passed. Not far away, one finds Kovalevskaya’s house. Behind the official biographies of scientists sometimes one does not see living personalities, while we, on the contrary, have tried to include in the texts as many personal stories as possible. 
The past not merely is not fugitive, it remains present. It is not within a few months only after the outbreak of a war that laws passed without haste can effectively influence its course, it is not within fifteen years only after a crime which has remained obscure that a magistrate can still find the vital evidence which will throw a light on it... 
Marcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time 
. Finally, the history of mathematics can also be looked at as a legacy composed of ideas. Mathematicians have long drawn inspiration from the classical works of their predecessors. Bunyakovsky engaged Chebyshev in the publication of Euler’s works. In the process of editing, Chebyshev became interested in number theory and proved his famous estimates on the density of the distribution of prime numbers. 
Besides biographical articles, the book includes mathematical notes — on Monge–Kantorovich’s transportation problem, on the Vinogradov circle method, on Fedorov’s crystallography, on Chebyshev’s results in problems of cartography, and so on,  notes in all. Our authors have tried to show classical results in a new light whenever possible and appropriate. We hope that readers can gain inspiration and new insights from leafing through this book.

Is there something special and unique about St. Petersburg mathematicians and their mathematics? We certainly think so. Despite being a relatively young city, St. Petersburg, just over  years old, has established a prominent place for itself in the world of mathematics. It was therefore fitting that St. Petersburg was selected to host the ICM , where we planned a grand celebration of mathematics, welcoming mathematicians from all around the
 Foreword and acknowledgments 
globe. We wanted to give everyone a taste of local mathematical traditions, so we decided to prepare a short, coffee-table book to present some mathemat ical discoveries and personal anecdotes from around twenty St. Petersburg mathematicians. The goal was to make the content informative yet accessible, even for those who aren’t particularly interested in the history or study of mathematics, showcasing the beauty of mathematical ideas and portraying their authors as relatable humans, rather than as cold-hearted calculators. 
However, as often happens, life had other plans. The book was never published in its intended form, as the congress was moved online by the IMU EC. As we worked on what was initially meant to be a brief and light-hearted book, it began to evolve into something more comprehensive and profound, in a very different genre. While this new direction may appeal to a smaller audience, in our view it has become more interesting and informative. We still hope that this new format will attract many readers, not just mathematicians interested in their field’s development, but even those well-versed in history who might find something new and worthwhile. 
Should we be interested in the history of mathematical discoveries and the stories of the people behind them? We believe so, as these stories are not only engaging but can also teach us valuable lessons for our lives and studies today. Perhaps it’s fitting that a new book in a new form emerged, especially as it coincides with the celebration of  years of science in St. Petersburg in .

First years of mathematics in the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences
Christian Goldbach (––) 
Christian Goldbach was a man of many talents: throughout his life he practiced law, music theory, he worked on deciphering letters of foreign diplo mats while serving in the postal censorship offices and rose to the rank of Privy Councillor  under Empress Elizabeth. He studied the Riccati equation, series summation and convergence; he extensively corresponded with Euler, stimulating the latter’s interest in number theory. 
A descendant of an ancient Prussian family, he was born on  March  in Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad), the son of Pastor Bartholomeus Goldbach, ¨ a professor of history and rhetoric at the local university. While studying law at the University of Konigsberg, Christian Goldbach spent much time learning ¨ mathematics, as the pages of his diary attest. 
Upon completion of studies, the young man set off on a journey while looking for a way to fulfill his secret desire. He wrote to Teuerlain: 
I had always dreamed of putting my energies into algebra and having an experienced teacher, who would introduce me to sources and stimulate me with new problems to move forward. 
During long visits to European universities (––), he collected an tiquities and books and visited libraries. Among those he met were Christian Wolff, Gottfried Leibniz, Isaac Newton, the Bernoulli family, and Abraham de Moivre. Goldbach engaged in correspondence with some of them, discussing mathematical problems. Everywhere he was received with a warm welcome, probably due to his varied interests and his gift as a brilliant conversationalist. 
He had a rare ability to instantly make acquaintances and then maintain connections via correspondence with people of all kinds. He defended his law thesis On the Punishment of Kidnapping in Groningen while staying there for two weeks. 
When the Prussian king granted him the rank of hofrat (court counselor), Goldbach spent three years in Konigsberg, corresponding with friends, before ¨ setting off again, this time traveling north, first to Sweden, performing unoffi cial diplomatic work along the way, then on to Denmark, Austria, and Venice. 
 A position roughly equivalent to vice-admiral or deputy minister. 
 Teuerlein, David Andreas (––). A theologian and amateur mathematician.  Christian von Wolff, (––). A German encyclopedist, actively involved in the search for candidates to form the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg.
 Christian Goldbach 
From , Goldbach’s correspondence with the Nuremberg physicist Jo hann Gabriel Doppelmayr mentions the Academy being established in St. Pe tersburg and Johann Daniel Schumacher selecting candidates for it from among European scientists on behalf of the Russian tsar. Invitations to St. Pe tersburg had already been received by his friends (Jacob Hermann and Georg Bernhard Bilfinger, Daniel and Nicolaus Bernoulli), and Goldbach decided to travel there even without being invited. On his way from Riga, he wrote to Blumentrost, with whom he was closely acquainted, and was not deterred by Blumenrost’s reply that all positions at the Academy had been already taken. In August , he was in St. Petersburg, ahead of Hermann and Bilfinger. 
Goldbach’s encyclopedic knowledge and conversational skills had been ap preciated by the academic administration, and a position as Academy secretary and historiographer was quickly found for him. Goldbach also had time for mathematics since his secretarial duties, which included writing minutes of meetings, preparing academic work for publication, and keeping up with cor respondence, hardly weighed heavily on him. True, his minutes were rather concise, but he was occasionally allowed to present his mathematical findings at the Academy Conference.  He also took part in the selection of candidates for positions at the Academy and established contacts with other international Academies. 
At the same time, he was appointed Peter II’s tutor in St. Petersburg at the request of Empress Catherine I. Goldbach even followed the Tsar’s court to Moscow in January  and lived there until . While in Moscow, he took care of the academic affairs of the Academy in St. Petersburg, he wrote a pref ace to Volume I of Commentaries of the Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, an obituary to Nicolaus Bernoulli, and several mathematical papers. 
Goldbach returned to St. Petersburg together with Anna Ioannovna’s court in January , where he was appointed chairman of the Conference of the Academy of Sciences. He was in charge of all scientific affairs of the Academy for the next  months, before returning to his previous duties when a new president of the Academy was appointed. 
In March , early in Elizaveta Petrovna’s reign, Goldbach accepted an offer to join the Collegium of Foreign Affairs (located in Moscow). It is not entirely clear, however, what, as State Councillor () and Privy Councillor (), Christian Goldbach was doing for  years as a diplomat. 
At first, Goldbach often came to St. Petersburg on business, visited the Academy of Sciences during celebrations and public assemblies, delivered

 The centerpiece of the Academy’s scientific activity was its Conference, which met twice a week. The earliest minutes of the scientific meeting of the Conference date from  November . That day the academician Jacob Hermann gave a report on the shape of the Earth.

speeches and poems, and shone at high society receptions and at court. He did not return to St. Petersburg during the last ten years of his life (––). He corresponded regularly with Euler, often discussing mathematical prob lems. When Count Alexey Petrovich Bestuzhev-Ryumin joined the Collegium and established a service of censorship and perlustration of the encrypted correspondence of foreign diplomats, Christian Goldbach became the head of its deciphering service. Goldbach’s successful decryption of ciphers and his development of new ones for secret correspondence were of enormous political importance to Russia. 
Goldbach’s finest hour came in  when he decrypted a ciphered dispatch sent to Paris by the French ambassador, the Marquis de La Ch´etardie. This became a textbook case in the history of cryptography []. Ch´etardie knew his letters were being opened but was convinced of the impossibility of decrypting his cipher. So he wrote light-heartedly about the Empress, saying she was wholly given over to pleasure, was frivolous, stupid, and vain. Bestuzhev Ryumin, who had become Chancellor by then, cleverly used this text in his fight against the “French” court party: by that time, he already had the deciphered texts of practically all the letters from the ambassador in his posses sion. He acted out the scene of deciphering the dispatch in front of Elizabeth “forcedly” uttering “reviling words.” 
On  June , Ch´etardie was expelled from the country. On  July, Goldbach became an Active State Councillor. 
An analysis of Christian Goldbach’s scientific legacy, his correspondence with Nicolaus and Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Gottfried Leibniz, and Jacob Hermann, and an analysis of his works is available in []. By the time Goldbach arrived in St. Petersburg, several of his articles on arithmetic and algebra had been published in the German periodical Acta Eruditorum. During the Russian period of his life, six scientific articles were published in the first four volumes (––) of the newly established Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperiali. These are papers on number theory, the integration of differential equations, and infinite series; in addition, a large number of Gold bach’s results appear in his correspondence. In , in correspondence with Nicolaus (II) Bernoulli, Goldbach presented some cases of the integrability of the Riccati equation 
y0 = cy2 + bx py + axm.

 Christian Goldbach 
In ––, in letters to Daniel Bernoulli, Goldbach gave the first example of a transcendental number,  and asked the question about the integrability in finite form of the differential binomial 
Z 
xm(a + bxn)pdx, m, n, p ∈ Q. 
After receiving Goldbach’s letter, Bernoulli and Euler, living in the same apartment, even made a bet for one ducat (a –– gramm gold coin) that Bernulli could not take this integral for m = 0, p = −1/n in  days, but Bernoulli found it immediately. In , Goldbach found all the cases m, n, p when this integral can be expressed in algebraic form. 
Goldbach’s correspondence with Leonhard Euler lasted for  years, and we owe the formulation of the famous Goldbach’s problems () to it: “Every odd integer greater than five can be represented as a sum of three prime numbers” (the ternary problem) and “Every even integer greater than two can be represented as the sum of two prime numbers” (the binary problem). For all sufficiently large odd numbers, the ternary problem was solved by Ivan Vinogradov () and Yuri Linnik (), and completely by Harald Helfgott (), a mathematician of Peruvian origin. The Goldbach–Euler binary prob lem is still open. 
Part of Goldbach’s correspondence with Daniel and Nicolaus (II) Bernoulli ( and  letters, respectively) and Euler ( letters) was edited and pub lished by Euler’s great-grandson Paul Fuss in  []. 
Christian Goldbach died on  November . He was buried in the Lutheran section of the Sampsoniyevskoye cemetery in St. Petersburg.

 It was the number P∞n=110−(2n−1). Its transcendence was proved only in , by Rodion Kuzmin [], also a St. Petersburg mathematician. In , Kuzmin proved the transcendence of the numbers ab, where a is algebraic and b is a real quadratic irrational number. For the case of an arbitrary irrational algebraic b, this is Hilbert’s seventh problem, which was solved in  by Alexander Gelfond (Moscow) and Theodor Schneider (Frankfurt) independently.

This note discusses Goldbach’s decipherment of the letter by the French ambassador, the Marquis de La Ch´etardie, of February , . It was shown to Empress Elizabeth and led to the ambassador’s expulsion. The structure of the cipher is described, and considerations are given as to how easy it is to crack. 
Having arrived in Russia for the second time in , the Marquis de La Ch´etardie counted on Empress Elizabeth’s kind attitude towards him. He knew that his letters were intercepted by the Russians, but he was absolutely sure that his cipher could not be cracked, so he wrote openly everything he thought. 
For example, in his letter of  February , which we are going to discuss, he wrote: 
...The Empress, by virtue of her laziness, laid everything on Bestuzhev... 
Ch´etardie was using the so-called Great Cipher (Grand Chiffre), developed by Antoine Rossignol for the French court during the reign of Louis XIV, in the second half of the XVII century. This cipher uses three-digit numbers to encode words, letters, sounds, and syllables, with several numbers used interchangeably for the same frequently occurring syllables. Some numbers are meaningless and are added to make it harder to break the cipher.

In , Brevern tempted Christian Goldbach over from the Academy of Sciences to serve in the Collegium of Foreign Affairs, with a salary of

rubles a year (approximately two or three professorship salaries nowadays). Bestuzhev–Ryumin later involved Goldbach in deciphering foreign correspon dence. Goldbach did not crack the Ch´etardie cipher instantly, but by , he had had two years’ experience of cracking ciphers, and while the first few ciphers took him the whole first year to crack, this one he cracked within a fortnight. 
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs archive, where Goldbach’s hand written transcripts are kept, is closed to external visitors. However, it appears this was not always the case since Tatiana Soboleva, the author of the History of Cryptography in Russia (), quotes these transcripts abundantly. 
Hence, I had to look into French archives.Indeed, the letters from Ch´etardie are preserved in the Archives du minist`ere des Affaires Etrangeres ´ ,  rue Suzanne Masson,  La Courneuve, France. On the previous page is a reproduction of such a letter. 
The beginning of the letter, dated  February, looks like this:
         
       
Since I had in possession several decrypted letters, I deduced the meaning of most of the numbers. In this excerpt, the first numbers    mean nothing and are added to complicate the task for an unwanted reader. 
It is not easy to solve this cipher, even with a deciphered version in front of you. I thought at first that the words in one line corresponded to the numbers in the line below and tried to find matches. The assumption turned out to be wrong. The person who deciphered the letters wrote on top of the lines of the cipher, filling in the lines to the end, and the corresponding numbers might go a couple of lines below. Sometimes, the decipherment is done by meaning rather than verbatim; sometimes, you cannot make out what is meant (perhaps Ch´etardie confused a digit or two). 
The matter progressed when, after several hours of studying the text, it struck me that the number  probably corresponds to the word Tsarine. After that, things went much faster—it became possible to match the numbers right after and before  with the corresponding text. 
Note the old spelling — logeoit instead of the modern logeait, seurement instead of surement ˆ . Sometimes, Ch´etardie encoded a word exactly how it was spelled, sometimes as it was pronounced, and sometimes, he used abbrevia tions when the word was clear from the context. 
I am grateful to Jean-Fred Warlin for photographing the letters for me.

Par la mort de Brevern — after the death of Brevern.  
So, how could Goldbach crack such a cipher? Let him speak for himself (from a letter from Goldbach to Bestuzhev–Ryumin): 
My dear Sir! 
Having brought to Your Excellency the first fruits of the third key, I hope that, instead of reproaching me for any slowness in this, there will be more reason to wonder at my haste, should one ever please to compare the key itself with the letters unscrambled and when it would be clear that it was required to examine every number or every figure very diligently, so it would be possible to learn the content of just one letter. But since all this work has already been done, I am in a position to give one piece a day, provided that I am not prevented from doing so by other things. As for the fourth and fifth keys, of which I also have several items [letters] in my hands, I find the aforesaid keys incomparably more difficult than the first ones... 
Once at least a few numbers are correctly solved (or the indicative content of the letter is known), further deciphering becomes so much easier. We can assume that Goldbach knew French, had an idea of the current political situation, and understood that numbers encode not separate characters but syllables or even words. We can also assume that Goldbach received all of Ch´etardie’s letters (the techniques for intercepting letters, opening and copy ing them were well established by then). 
Even so, it was not at all clear how such a cipher could be broken: on his return to France, on September , , Ch´etardie had his servant-secretary Dupr´e, who had access to the cipher, taken to the Bastille, suspecting treason on his part. The secretary was interrogated for five months before being found

to be completely innocent and a naive simpleton, and released (Louis XV even awarded him compensation for his time in prison). 
However, it is possible to make a few guesses even without access to the cipher. For example, a frequency analysis of the numbers shows that some numbers occur much more frequently than others. Here are some that occur more than  times in this letter: 
 la ( times) 
 que ( times) 
 a ( times) 
 raˆı or r, r´e ( times) 
 le ( times) 
 s’ ( times) 
 de or d´e ( times) 
 et ( times) 
 pour ( times). 
So, while frequency analysis is not directly applicable, Goldbach could match these numbers to the most frequent French syllables, significantly re ducing the enumeration of variants. 
Furthermore, there are numbers in the letter, and they are not encrypted, e.g., d´epˆeches des  et  janvier looks like      . The letters did not always reach their addressees, so Ch´etardie resent some letters and mentioned the date of the letters previously sent. That is how we learn that  is et (and) and  is janvier (January). 
Syllables in French words are rarely repeated, but in superstitieux (su) (pers) (ti) (ti) (eux), the syllable ti is repeated. Undoubtedly, Goldbach had a list of words with repeated syllables, as it was one of the well known(!) methods of breaking ciphers. Sometimes, Ch´etardie would start or end a letter with a paragraph of unencrypted text, for example, saying that he has already sent this letter and that he duplicates it just in case. If he was not careful enough, such letters may not have been identical — which would have given information as to which numbers stood for the same thing. Another possibility is that Goldbach could have gotten hold of a draft letter (taken from a waste bin, perhaps), which could be compared to all the encrypted letters, and that would have given enough information to decrypt the cipher. 
Thus, although breaking such a cipher seems to be a completely hopeless task at first, Goldbach did have ways in which he could make a start, for Ch´etardie, confident that the cipher could not be broken, was unlikely to be careful about the frequency of numbers, references to dates, or repeated syllables. 
Regardless of the method of deciphering, at three o’clock in the morning on June , , soldiers led by General Ushakov came to Ch´etardie. They ordered him to leave Moscow within a day and Russia within eight days and forcibly took from him Elizabeth’s portrait, which had been given to him by the Empress herself.

In January , a new contract with Goldbach was entered into, precisely due to his success in deciphering. The minutes of the reports to Elizabeth on  January  state: 
... . Her Imperial Majesty [Elizabeth] deigns to hear and most gra ciously approves the draft contract concluded by State Councilor Gold bach regarding his entry into Russian service. Following his humble report, it is proposed that he, Goldbach, be awarded up to  roubles as a reward for his diligent work and special skill in deciphering secret letters, which Her Imperial Majesty has most graciously approved.

Daniel Bernoulli (––) 
Daniel Bernoulli, one of the great scientists of the XVIIIth century, was born on the th of January, , in Groningen, Holland, to Johann Bernoulli, a professor of mathematics at the local university, who later became one of the greatest mathematicians in Europe. Johann spent a lot of time teaching mathematics to his sons Daniel and Nicolaus (––) and instilled in them a lifelong love for the subject. In , the family moved to Basel, where Jo hann was offered a post as a professor of mathematics at the university, which became vacant after the death of his el 
der brother, the famous mathematician Jacob 
Bernoulli. Daniel’s childhood was peaceful, 
typical of the family of a successful scientist like 
his father. 
Daniel graduated from the Basel Gymna 
sium at the age of thirteen, and three years 
later he was awarded a master’s degree in phi 
losophy. At his father’s insistence, Daniel began 
to study medicine, as the practice of medicine 
has always ensured material well-being and a 
dignified position in society. It is worth noting 
that Daniel’s father himself, on the advice of his 
elder brother Jacob, studied medicine, became 
a Doctor of Medicine, and alternated lecturing 
in mathematics at the University of Basel with 
medical practice. 
In , Daniel went to Heidelberg to continue his studies of medicine under the eminent physician Nebel and moved to Strasbourg the following year to improve his knowledge of anatomy and surgery. He returned to Basel in , defended his dissertation On Breathing, and was awarded the degree of Licentiate of Medicine. 
Daniel’s serious studies of mathematics started in his native Basel in ––, but he did not abandon medicine. In , Daniel went abroad again, this time to Venice, to complete his medical studies under the guid ance of the famous Italian physician Michelotti. He successfully combined his medical studies with mathematics. In , Bernoulli published his first mathematical work Mathematical Exercises. He got help from his friend, a
 Daniel Bernoulli 
noble Venetian, who printed several copies at his own expense. The work was devoted to defending the ideas of Daniel Bernoulli’s father and uncle against the unfounded attacks of Italian scientists. This research made him famous in Italian scientific circles, and the Academy of Sciences in Bologna included him on its membership list. 
From , the Acad´emie des Sciences de Paris began to run competitions for finding the best solutions to various scientific problems, awarding generous prizes to the winners. In this way, the Academy incentivized scientists to solve the most urgent problems while contributing to the development of science. The first competition was devoted to the subject “On the best way to construct an hourglass or water clock used on ships.” Daniel Bernoulli sent his solution to Paris and was awarded a prize. Overall, between  and , he was awarded prizes ten times and was second only to Euler in the number of prizes he received. 
In , the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences was established, and Nico laus and Daniel Bernoulli were invited to join. They arrived in St. Petersburg on the th of October . Daniel got the position of chair of physiology with a salary of  rubles a year, and Nicolaus got the chair of mathematics with a salary of  rubles a year. Unfortunately, Nicolaus, a brilliant math ematician, was not in good health and died seven months later, just after his wedding. Empress Catherine I personally expressed her condolences to Daniel on the death of his brother. 
Daniel Bernoulli’s activities in St. Petersburg were extraordinarily produc tive. During his first year at the Academy, he made more than ten presenta tions on solving problems in mathematics and mechanics, related to physiol ogy. In , he began to work on Hydrodynamica and carried out numerous experiments to test his hypotheses. 
Unfortunately, the harsh St. Petersburg climate was affecting his health, and in  he tendered his resignation to the authorities of the Academy. On the th of July of that year, he left St. Petersburg after eight years of service. He returned to Basel, where he took up the chair of anatomy and botany. In , he was offered the chair of physics at the University of Basel and held it until the last years of his life. In , Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica in Strasbourg, the work that brought him worldwide fame. 
It should be noted that Daniel’s association with the St. Petersburg Academy did not cease after his departure. In , Daniel Bernoulli was elected an honorary member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences with an annual pension of  rubles. Most of his papers were published in St. Pe tersburg: overall, between  and ,  out of  papers saw the light of day there. 
Bernoulli’s main works relate to hydrodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases, and the theory of periodic motion. Bernoulli, along with D’Alembert and Euler, laid the foundations for the theory of partial differential equations. Probability

theory also occupied an important place in his research. His most famous paper, An Attempt at a New Theory for Calculating the Probability of Random Variables, was published in St. Petersburg in . In this paper, Bernoulli introduced the concept of “moral expectation.” He applied this notion to a problem that was called the “St. Petersburg game.” 
The problem is put as follows: two players, Paul and Peter, are playing. Peter tosses a coin; if it is tails, he pays Paul a ducat and the game ends; if it is heads, the game continues. If it’s tails the second time, Peter pays Paul two ducats, and the game ends; if it’s heads again, the game continues. The third time, it’s either four ducats or the game continues, then either eight ducats or 
 This might have been an allusion to the preeminent apostles Peter and Paul, who have an infinite time to play.
 Daniel Bernoulli 
the game continues, and so on. For the game to start, Paul has to give Peter a certain amount of money in advance for the sake of fairness, which must equal the mathematical expectation of the winnings. In this case, the possible values of the winnings are , , , , etc. Thus, the mathematical expectation of Paul’s winnings is 12· 1 +14· 2 +18· 4 + …, thus being infinite. However, the moral expectation of his winnings, according to Bernoulli’s theory, will be finite. (Bernoulli’s main argument is that the utility of money is multiplicative, not additive, and the value of one ducat for someone who has only ten of them is much greater than for someone who has a thousand). This sophistry has been called the “St. Petersburg paradox.” An explanation of the paradox of the “Petersburg Game” was given by Alexander Khinchin in , in his work On the Petersburg Game. 
Bernoulli’s scientific achievements were highly esteemed by his contempo raries. In his home country, he was elected Rector of Basel University twice. He was also elected a member of many foreign academies and scientific soci eties, including the Berlin Academy of Sciences in , the Paris Academy of Sciences in , and the Royal Societyin . Daniel Bernoulli was among seven foreign scientists honored by Empress Catherine II with the gift of a personal copy of the gold medal minted in commemoration of the victory over the Ottoman Empire. 
Daniel Bernoulli lived a long life; he never married. He coined the terms “hydrodynamics” and “steady state,” which became universally accepted and are still in use today. In his later years, Bernoulli turned to charity. At his own expense, he built a small hotel for traveling students and scientists, where they could find food and shelter. He was a modest and well-balanced man, well respected not only by his colleagues but by everyone who knew him.

Bernoulli’s principle in hydrodynamics 
Daniel Bernoulli is often regarded as the father of hydrodynamics. “It seems that the first person to use this term was M. Daniel Bernoulli, who gave this title to his Treatise of fluid motions, printed in Strasbourg in  []. If the title was new, it must be admitted that the work was also new. M. Daniel Bernoulli seems to be the first who reduced the laws of fluid motion to safe and non arbitrary principles, which none of the authors of hydraulics had done before him. The same author had already given in , in the Memoirs of the Academy of Petersburg [], an essay on his new theory.” (D’Alembert, []). 
As a mathematician and physicist, Bernoulli used analysis, particularly dif ferential calculus, to formalize some fundamental laws of fluid mechanics and put them into equations. 
 A problem of vessels and drain 
His memoir Hydrodynamica [], dedicated to the Duke of Courland and Semigallia Biron, brings together various theoretical contributions and com ments on the subject of fluid forces and movements, corroborated by numer ous experiments. 
These include fluids flowing through vessels with various shapes of open ings or pipes, driving effect by rotation or translation of the vessels, and even an (unrealistic) application to navigation.

. A counter-intuitive result. The starting point of all his computations, now referred to as Bernoulli’s principle, relates the velocity of a fluid to its pressure at a given point. It can be stated as follows 
Bernoulli’s principle. In a horizontally flowing fluid, the pressure of the fluid at points where its velocity is high is lower than the pressure of the fluid at points where its velocity is low. 
Thus, in a horizontal pipe with sections of different diameters, the pressure of the water in the sections where the water is flowing fast is lower than in the
 Bernoulli’s principle in hydrodynamics 
sections where the water is flowing slowly. This may seem counter-intuitive, as one would tend to associate high velocity with high pressure. However, this principle simply translates to the fact that water will accelerate if there is more pressure behind it than in front of it. 
. A counterpart of Huygens principle in mechanics. Bernoulli derived this principle by analogy with the living force principle of Huygens in mechan ics []. In his own words, the proof is the following : 
“The potential elevation of the system, each part of which is moved by any velocity, shows the vertical height which the center of gravity of this system reaches, if each particle, by the upward movement raised by its velocity, is understood to rise as far as it can. 
The vertical height marks the actual descent by which the center of gravity descends after each particle has been at rest. 
The potential elevation is necessarily equal to the actual descent when all motion remains in the spread matter.” (Bernoulli, []) 
The potential elevation is therefore connected to the velocity, which is itself computed in terms of the flux: “The movement of fluids is very close to such that everywhere the velocity is reciprocally proportional to the corresponding size of the vessel” (Bernoulli, []). The actual descent is expressed in terms of the pressure using the laws of hydrostatics.
Bernoulli’s principle in hydrodynamics  
Bernoulli was then able to use these conservation laws on infinitesimal volumes and introduced geometric considerations to compute, for instance, the drain rate of a vessel. 
 Modern formulation 
Bernoulli’s original text is quite difficult to access today: the terminology no longer corresponds to current standards, the hypotheses are not always clearly formulated (except in the form of rules for applications), and the notations are very confusing. 
The principle is nevertheless explained nowadays in a simple form in all fluid mechanics courses. 
. The pressure, a macroscopic observation of internal interactions. The pressure involved in Bernoulli’s principle is the internal pressure of the fluid, which is exerted in all directions as the fluid flows. Note that this pressure is not the same as the pressure the fluid would exert on an object that would get in its way and stop its movement. 
It is interesting to note that Bernoulli’s memoir actually contains the first elements of the kinetic theory of gases: fluid particles have a state of thermal agitation that is all the more vivid the higher the pressure. The pressure is, in fact, the result of the many shocks between these fluid particles. 
. A global energy balance. It is the pressure of the neighboring portions of the fluid that is the source of the force providing the fluid with the work necessary for its acceleration. 
Consider a pipe in which water is flowing in a laminar way from left to right. When the volume of water, shown in dark blue in the figure below, reaches the narrow part of the pipe, its speed increases. The pressure force generated by the pressure on the left of the volume of water in question pushes it to the right and provides it with positive work since it pushes it in the direction of its movement. The pressing force generated by the pressure to the right of the volume of water under consideration pushes it to the left and provides it with negative work since it pushes it in the opposite direction to its displacement. 
It is known that the water must accelerate (for conservation of the volume flow), and therefore the total work supplied by the pressure forces to the portion of fluid considered must be positive. 
The work WF of a force F (parallel to the motion) is written Fd, d being the distance traveled when the force is applied. The pressure force is given by PS, P being the pressure and S being the area to which the pressure is applied. Thus, we write : 
Wpressure = PSd .
 Bernoulli’s principle in hydrodynamics 
One of the experements from Bernoulli’s Hydrodynamica book. 
The area S` on the left is larger than the area Sr on the right. But when the volume of the water under consideration enters the narrow part of the pipe, it deforms and lengthens: the pressure force due to P` on the right-hand side is therefore applied over a greater distance d`than the pressure force due to Pr on the left-hand side. The total volume of the section of water studied remains constant S`d` = Srdr. Therefore, the pressure P` of the water on the left must be greater than the pressure Pr of the water on the right for the sum of the work done on the volume of the water studied to be positive overall. 
 Euler equations versus Bernoulli equation 
Bernoulli’s principle can be made more quantitative by writing a detailed energy balance. This leads, in particular, to clarifying the assumptions on the flow. 
. An inviscid incompressible flow. Bernoulli’s work mainly concerns water, which is considered incompressible. Section  of Hydrodynamica pro poses actually an extension to the case of “elastic fluids,” taking into account the effects of compressibility (which was a very original contribution), but we will not treat this case here. 
Bernoulli also specifies in his manuscript that he neglects all the effects of viscosity, and in particular the adhesion to the boundary (which he calls “friction” or “tenacity” of the fluid). 
For an incompressible inviscid fluid of density ρ, Euler’s (later) work [] shows that the dynamic equation governing the flow can be written as 

  
∇x· u = 0 
| {z } 
incompressibility constraint ρ · (∂tu +(u ·∇x)u) | {z } 
acceleration along the flow 
= −ρgez −∇xP | {z } forces 
()

Bernoulli’s principle in hydrodynamics  
where x = (x1, x2, z) is the D vector of spatial coordinates, u = u(t, x) is a D vector field representing the bulk velocity of the fluid at time t at a given position x, g is the gravity and P = P(t, x) is the (scalar) pressure. From the mathematical point of view, P is just the Lagrange multiplier associated with the incompressibility constraint. Indeed, taking the divergence of the second equation, we get ∇x· ((u · ∇x)u) = −∆xP , meaning that P depends in a non local way on u and its derivatives and on the boundary conditions. 
Note that the Eulerian description of the fluid with u and P is, in a way, the point of view of an observer who stands at a given position (as opposed to the Lagrangian description following the fluid particles). 
. The Bernoulli equation. In his work, Bernoulli also restricts his at tention to a steady state flow, which implies that the Eulerian velocity field u does not depend on time u = u(x). Recall that this does not mean that a given fluid particle has a constant velocity, but that at any given point in the domain occupied by the fluid, an observer always sees the same flow. The fluid particles, on the other hand, are advected by the flow: they move along the streamlines with a velocity that will be precisely given by Bernoulli’s relation. 
The last assumption, which is not formulated in a very precise and rigorous way, concerns the geometry of the flow. Bernoulli assumes for simplicity that the fluid is “divided into layers perpendicular to the direction of motion”, and that “the particles of fluid [are] moved with the same velocity, so that every where the velocity of the fluid is reciprocally proportional to the corresponding magnitude of the vessel.” This assumption can be relaxed by considering a small tube of fluid around a field line, but a necessary condition is that these lines remain approximately parallel, i.e. that the flow is laminar. 
The definition of laminar flow is actually not completely consensual. We will limit ourselves here to the case of irrotational flows rot u = 0. Since u is also divergence-free, the convection term can be rewritten 
(u ·∇x)u = ∇x|u|2 
2− u∧(rot u)− u(∇x· u) = ∇x|u|2 
2. 
which is also a potential term. We therefore end up with Bernoulli’s equation 

 
∇x 
ρ|u|2 
2+ρgz + P 
 
= 0. 

For general laminar incompressible flows, the conservation holds only along the flow lines : 
u · (u ·∇x)u = (u ·∇x)|u|2 
2, 
so that, given two points l and r on the same flow line 
2+ρgz` + P` = ρ|ur|2 

ρ|u`|2 
2+ρgzr + Pr. 

This implies, in particular, Bernoulli’s principle (with zl = zr).
 Bernoulli’s principle in hydrodynamics 
However, the assumption of a permanent laminar flow in the geometry considered by Bernoulli is questionable. It is briefly discussed in his disser tation, but the physical phenomena involved are extremely complicated and are actually still poorly understood. 
 Eddies and turbulence 
This final section provides an overview of the complexity mentioned above. 
. Creation of vorticity. As shown previously, an irrotational flow satisfies the Bernoulli relation. On the other hand, it is easy to verify that an incom pressible inviscid flow (with impermeability condition u · n = 0 on the walls) does not create vorticity. Indeed, in two dimensions of space, the vorticity ω =∇⊥x· u is simply transported 
∂tω +(u ·∇x)ω = 0, 
and therefore conserved. In three dimensions of space, the vorticity Ω=rot u satisfies 
∂tΩ+(u ·∇x)Ω = Ω·∇xu. 
There is an additional “stretching” term, but if the vorticity is initially zero, it remains so (provided that the solution is smooth enough to make sense of the stability estimate). 
Bernoulli indicated in his memoir that his model is locally flawed, especially near the opening and the boundaries of the vessel, due to viscosity (which is never exactly zero) and wall adhesion. The Euler equations () were general ized for viscous fluids by Navier [] and Stokes [] 

  
∇x· u = 0 
∂tu +(u ·∇x)u 
| {z } acceleration 
= −gez −∇xPρ | {z } forces 
+ ν∆xu 
| {z } 
viscosity 
() 

where the viscosity term (with ν > 0) accounts for the non-conservative in ternal forces (friction between neighboring fluid particles having different speeds). These equations do not seem at first sight to be very different from (), especially when the Reynolds number (proportional to 1/ν) is very large. In particular, we have the transport-diffusion equation for vorticity Ω 
∂tΩ+(u ·∇x)Ω−ν∆xΩ = Ω·∇xu, 
which should preserve the irrotationality of the flow. 
However, as the Navier–Stokes equations are of order  (the Laplacian involves second derivatives), one must impose more conditions on the bound aries, which allow in particular to model the effect of adhesion to the wall (u=0 on the walls). This condition is, in general, different from the prediction given by Euler’s equations for an inviscid fluid. It is therefore expected that
Bernoulli’s principle in hydrodynamics  
even weakly viscous fluids (ν << 1) behave very differently from ideal fluids (ν = 0), especially in the vicinity of the walls. Observations show that small vortices are generated near the walls and can potentially destabilize the whole fluid. 
. Transition to turbulence. Prandtl was the first to study these boundary effects in more detail, introducing the notion of boundary layer and character izing it by means of multi-scale expansions []. The main idea is that far from the boundary the viscous flow should resemble the idealized flow uE governed by (), which is then connected to the boundary condition by a fairly steep 
profile defined on a layer of size pν. To understand this connection, the idea is to zoom in on the direction orthogonal to the boundary at scale pν. For a sta tionary flow, in the simple geometry where the domain is D and the boundary 
is x2 = 0, the equation for this profile u =v1(x1, x2/pν),pνv1(x1, x2/pν)  

reads  
∇x· v = 0 
(v ·∇x)v1 − ∂2x2 x2v1 = −∂x1pE(x1, 0) v(x1, 0) = 0, limx2→∞v(x1, x2) = uE(x1, 0) 
() 

where (x1, x2) are the tangential and normal coordinates and uE, pE are the velocity and pressure obtained by the Euler equation (). 
Unfortunately, this equation is not always mathematically well posed. The stability of the boundary layer (and thus the validity of the two-scale expan sion) is conditional on the fact that the gradient of pressure imposed by the internal flow ∂x1pE(x1, 0) does not become positive and too large. Physically,

in the case of flow around an obstacle, it is observed that the boundary layers that form upstream of the obstacle progressively lose their momentum and cannot climb the adverse (positive) pressure gradient downstream, so they separate from the wall. In other words, the interaction with the boundary is expected to create vorticity, and this vorticity is then propagated within the fluid in the form of small vortices at all scales. This has two extremely important consequences. On the one hand, even if the viscosity is small, the presence of these small structures makes the flow quite strongly dissipative. On the other hand, the velocity field loses its regularity, and the Navier–Stokes equations () themselves can become unstable. 
Understanding this transition mechanism to turbulence is a major chal lenge for physicists and mathematicians. Without making an exhaustive list of mathematical contributions on this subject, we can summarize the state of the art as follows 
• the multi-scale expansion proposed by Prandtl is justified in some situa tions when the boundary layer is stable, for instance, with a negative gradient of pressure [, , ] (see also [, , ] and the references therein). The separation of the boundary layer has been described formally by Goldstein [], and recently studied mathematically in []. 
• the instability of the flow in presence of small-scale structures is so strong that one even loses the uniqueness of solutions for the Euler equations [] as well as for the Navier–Stokes equations [, ]. This means that, for flows of this complexity, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to follow precisely all the details of the velocity field. 
• the enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping due to the combination of the small viscosity and the presence of small-scale structures are established for particular flows (typically shear flows) in the absence of boundaries (see the review [] for a simple presentation of these mechanisms). 
• in regimes when turbulence is fully developed, Kolmogorov proposed in  a statistical approach [], predicting, in particular, the distribution of eddies at different scales (see [] for instance). Although completely heuris tic, these predictions are consistent with the critical regularity for the Navier– Stokes equations (the threshold for the uniqueness [, ]). 
However the prediction of the emission of vortices at the boundary layer (destabilization of the laminar flow), the probabilistic study of the Navier– Stokes equations to rigorously derive the Kolmogorov model (fully turbulent regime), or the mathematical description of the transition between these two regimes remain very challenging open problems. They probably require a very different approach from the usual point of view adopted in PDEs, where one could take advantage of the instability and mixing properties as is the case for example in the KAM theory of dynamical systems (see [, ] for results in this direction).

Leonhard Euler (––) 
The breadth of Euler’s interests and the variety of his activities were not inferior to those of Leonardo da Vinci: besides being a mathematiciand and a physicist, he was an architect (he made calculations for the innovative Kulibin bridge project), a geographer (Euler was in charge of the compilation of the first Atlas of the Russian Empire), he was involved in military science, naviga tion, astronomy, etc. 
Euler obtained fundamental results and laid the foundations for many branches of mathematics: number theory (the Riemann zeta function and continuous fractions; he also introduced 
the concept of a primitive root of unity), 
analysis (elliptic functions, series summa 
tion), calculus of variations (the Euler–La 
grange equation), special functions, sur 
face geometry (the definition of curvature 
by normal cuts, equations of geodesics, the 
concept of conformal mapping). His re 
sults in mechanics are no less significant; it 
would suffice to mention Euler angles and 
the hydrodynamic Euler equation. 
Leonhard Euler, one of the greatest 
mathematicians ever, was born in Basel, 
Switzerland, on April th, , into the 
family of a poor Protestant priest. Basel 
was a center of European education and 
culture at the time. The University of Basel, 
founded in the XVIth century, was a hotbed of enlightenment ideals. During the mid-XVIth century, the Bernoulli family moved there from the Nether lands, a fact that would play an important role in Euler’s life. 
Leonhard Euler was initially educated by his father, who, as a young man, had successfully studied mathematics under Jacob Bernoulli. The pastor was preparing his son for a career in the clergy but taught him mathematics as well. While in his last year of grammar school, Euler attended lectures in mathematics at the university, where one of the greatest mathematicians of

the time taught: Johann Bernoulli (––), the younger brother of Jacob Bernoulli. Johann Bernoulli noticed the talented youth and advised him to study the primary sources independently. He also allowed him to come to his house on Saturday afternoons to discuss any difficult parts encountered. During these sessions, Euler met his sons Nicolaus (––) and Daniel (––). 
In  Euler was awarded a Master of Arts degree. For the test, he gave a speech in Latin comparing the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. At his father’s request, Euler studied theology. Both father and son realized that in Switzerland an academic career was unpromising: the number of applicants for professorships far exceeded the number of vacancies. In , Euler applied for the position of chair of physics at the University of Basel, but without success. 
Russia, St. Petersburg (––). Peter the Great wanted to establish an Academy of Sciences in Russia as early as the last years of the XVIIth century. He discussed his plans with the great Leibniz three times. Peter did not live to see the Academy established, because only in  did the Senate decide to establish the Academy of Sciences, and it was inaugurated by Catherine I in . 
The St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences stood out from other European academies in several ways. Firstly, it had a fixed budget of   rubles per year and generous remuneration for its professors; by comparison, the country’s total budget was about  million rubles. Secondly, the academy had a more universal character, consisting of three classes: mathematics, physics, and the humanities. Thirdly, the academy had a school and a university. 
There were not enough Russian scientists, so the government invited for eigners. Invitations were sent to the sons of the famous Johann Bernoulli — Nicolaus and Daniel. Nicolaus became a professor of mathematics, and Daniel became a professor of physiology. Euler, seeing his friends departing to Russia, had, in his own words, “an indescribable desire to go with them to St. Peters burg.” Daniel promised to put in a good word for him and fulfilled his promise: Euler was offered a position as an adjunct in the department of physiology, with a salary of  rubles a year. Leonhard was not embarrassed by the fact that he was to practice medicine. In those days medicine was not perceived as a science far removed from mathematics; for example, Johann Bernoulli alternated between mathematics and medical practice. 
In , twenty-year-old Euler, having received  rubles to cover travel expenses from the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, left for Russia. He became immediately involved in the intensive work of the Academy, and his papers published in the Commentaries of the St. Petersburg Imperial Academy of Sciences quickly earned him fame and a place of honor among mathematicians in Europe. In , Euler was already a professor of physics, with a salary of

 rubles. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli left for Basel, and Euler took the chair of mathematics with a salary of  rubles per year. Euler became one of the most important figures in the Academy of Sciences; he constantly presented papers, published articles, and did not refuse any assignments. He was involved in drawing up a general map of Russia and engaged in cartogra phy, but mathematics was the main thing in his life. It was during these years that he emerged as a great mathematician. However, the intense work had a detrimental effect on his health, and at the age of , he went blind in his right eye. 
On the th of January, , Euler married Katharina Gsell, the daughter of an academic painter from Switzerland. They lived happily for over  years, his wife bearing him  children, but only three sons and two daughters survived. 
Euler was a non-confrontational and deeply religious person. He was kind and could get on well with anyone. He worked under any circumstances and in any environment: “A baby on his lap, a cat on his back — that’s how he wrote his immortal works,” as Dieudonn´e Thi´ebault said. 
“[Euler] a fait faire aux sciences math´ematiques, des pas de g´eant; et ses immenses travaux ne lui coutoient rien : c’est au milieu de sa famille, et du bruit que des enfans peuvent f ˆ aire; c’est en ` jouant lui-mˆeme avec celui qu’il prenoit sur ses genoux, et avec un angola mont´e sur son ´epaule, qu’il a compos´e quelques-uns de ces M´emoires que l’Europe a admir´es et admirera toujours.” Dieudonn´e Thi´ebault, Mes souvenirs de vingt ans de s´ejour a Berlin ` , vol. , p.

By , Euler’s health had deteriorated due to constant overwork and the harsh climate in St. Petersburg. At that time, the Prussian King Frederick II intended to convert the Royal Society into an Academy of Sciences, and to this end he invited Euler to Berlin. Euler accepted the offer and on  May  he resigned from the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. However, he retained his honorary membership in the St. Petersburg Academy with a pension of  rubles a year. In June of , Leonhard Euler left St. Petersburg for Berlin. 
Prussia, Berlin (––). Euler’s Berlin period lasted for a quarter of a century, from  to . Euler’s relationship with the Prussian King went wrong. In Berlin, it was thought that the duty of a scientist was, among other things, to decorate parlors and to entertain guests with elegant conver sations. Euler did not do that; he engaged in mathematics. In , the Berlin Academy of Sciences was inaugurated, but Euler was not offered the position of president of the Academy after Leibniz left but was appointed director of the mathematical department of the Academy. 
Over the years in Berlin, he published  papers in the Proceedings of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences and  in the Proceedings of the Berlin

Academy of Sciences. He rendered numerous services to the Russian Academy of Sciences, took care of the replenishment of their libraries, and corresponded extensively with Russian academicians. It should be noted that throughout his life the great mathematician felt the deepest gratitude to the Russian Academy of Sciences, knowing that his move to St. Petersburg was of decisive impor tance for his life. 
In a letter to Schumacher on November th  Euler wrote: 
I and all the others who were lucky to be at the Russian Imperial Academy for some time must admit that everything we have become is due to the favorable circumstances in which we found ourselves. As for myself, in the absence of such excellent circumstances, I should have been obliged mainly to turn to other occupations in which, by all accounts, the only thing I could indulge in was penny-pinching. When his Royal Majesty asked me recently where I had learned what I know, I answered, telling the truth, that I owed everything to my stay at the Academy of St. Peters burg. 
Euler’s financial situation was more than modest. He was constantly con cerned about these financial difficulties, and in the early s he set up a boarding school at his house for his Russian students. 
Euler made every effort to ensure that his family had a comfortable life. In  he managed to buy a beautiful small estate in Charlottenburg, with a house and a garden. In , the Seven Years’ War between Prussia and Russia began. Life was becoming more expensive, money was losing value, yet wages were not increasing. The advancing Russian army destroyed the estate in Charlottenburg, and the Russian officers whom Euler knew in St. Petersburg, including his godson, persuaded Euler that he, as an honorary member of the Academy, could demand compensation. Euler wrote letters to St. Petersburg, including some to Lomonosov, but the matter dragged on. Only Catherine II, who ascended the throne after the coup of , ordered that Euler be com pensated for all the damages ( rubles, his annual salary in St. Petersburg) and asked him to return to St. Petersburg. 
 Schumacher, Johann Daniel, (––). The director of the Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences and later secretary of the Russian Academy of Sciences, responsible for dealing with all financial and economic matters. He was born in Alsace and came to Russia with Pierre Lefort, nephew of Peter the Great’s admiral. In , Peter the Great sent him to France, England, and the Netherlands, to persuade scholars recommended by Christian Wolff to come to Russia. He was married to the daughter of Peter the Great’s cook. 
 Lomonosov, Mikhail Vasilyevich, (––). The first Russian scientist, physicist, chemist, metallurgist, and creator of the kinetic molecular theory of heat. Lomonosov was of peasant stock, so he had to forge documents to enter the Slavic Greek Latin Academy in Moscow, the only higher education institution in Russia at the time. In , he enrolled as a student at the University of the Academy of Sciences (he subsequently became its member in ). In  he went to Marburg and was a pupil of Ch. Wolff. In , on his way back to Russia, he was commandeered into the Prussian army but escaped. In  he drew up a project for Moscow University, which was renamed Lomonosov University in  in his honor.
 Leonhard Euler 
Meanwhile, Euler’s position in Berlin weighed him down. In , Mauper tuis, president of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, died. Note that his salary was double that of Euler. Euler hoped that Friedrich would offer him the post, but in vain. Euler’s relations with Friedrich took a turn for the worse in the early s; the humiliating position he was put in was also pushing him towards a breakup: the great mathematician received a salary of , thalers per annum, or approximately  rubles. 
In December , Euler wrote to Chancellor Count Vorontsov requesting to be made a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler put forward the following demands: the post of vice-president with an annual salary of  rubles for himself, provision of a flat free of billeting, as well as a chair of physics for his eldest son with a salary of  rubles per year, and provision of decent jobs in medicine and artillery for his middle and younger sons. 
Vorontsov relayed Euler’s conditions to Catherine II, to which the empress replied “Of course, I find him quite worthy of the position he desires ... At the present state of the Academy, there is no money for the salary of  rubles, but for a man of such merit as Mr. Euler I shall add to the academic salaries from the state revenues, which together would amount to the requested  rubles. He will have official quarters and not the slightest shadow of a soldier. Although the Academy does not have a free chair of physics with a salary of  rubles for the eldest son, I will nevertheless assign it [the salary] to him, as well as an official private medical practice to the second son, and a guaranteed position should he wish to enter public service. The third son will have a position without any difficulty. I am sure that my Academy will rise from the ashes thanks to such an important acquisition, and I congratulate myself in advance on having returned the great man to Russia.” In , Euler was back in Russia. 
Russia, St. Petersburg (––). Leonhard Euler returned to St. Pe tersburg on the th of July . The next day, the empress received Euler and his two elder sons. Catherine II granted him  rubles in silver to buy a house. Euler bought one on the Nikolayevskaya embankment (Lieutenant Shmidt Embankment, nowadays), where he lived till the end of his days. School No.  is housed in that building these days, and a commemorative plaque hangs on its walls. 
Euler immediately became involved in the work of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. He brought many manuscripts back with him that he had not had time to publish in Berlin. Euler, still full of new ideas to pursue, worked with the same zeal as before. 
 A billet is a place where soldiers are housed temporarily. Rural and urban residents were supposed to provide free accommodation for soldiers because the Russian army didn’t have barracks during the whole of the th century, and being released from this duty as a resident was rare. Thus, an apartment free of billeting was quite a luxury.
Leonhard Euler  
Euler was interested in the problem of blood movement through the arter ies. The topic was important for military surgery. In January of , he took part in a discussion of Josias Weitbrecht’s work, On the Movement of Blood, at the Academy. In , Euler formulated and solved the problem of the flow of fluid in an elastic tube for the first time. 
In a paper in , Euler wrote about his investigations of the flow of blood through the arteries. Due to considerable mathematical difficulties, he was unable to solve the resulting system of equations and uttered the famous phrase: “If God had wanted us to understand the flow of blood through the arteries, he would not have invented such complex equations.” 
In , Euler’s wife died and was buried in the Smolensky Lutheran Ceme tery. In order not to change his way of life, Euler married her half-sister Abigail Gsell. Euler’s eyesight deteriorated dramatically. Catherine II summoned the famous oculist, Baron Wentzel, for Euler personally, and Wentzel successfully performed an operation to remove the cataract. Euler was ordered to rest his eyes for a few days after the procedure, but he could not restrain himself from continuing his work. As a result, Euler became permanently blind. 
Blindness began to be coupled with deafness, but nothing stopped Euler from working: he started dictating his writings. During the  remaining years of his life, he dictated  large books and over  articles. He managed to write very clearly on a black table with white chalk. In the later years of his life, academic publications could not keep up with the flow of works authored by the blind scholar. Euler jokingly promised the director of the Academy, Count Orlov, that his works would fill the Commentaries of the Academy for  years following his death. Indeed, the Academy continued publishing his works for  years after his death, bringing the number to . 
The th of September, , started as an ordinary day in Euler’s life: he was teaching mathematics to his grandson, doing calculations. At about  p.m., he felt the onset of an acute headache. Before he lost consciousness, he said: “I am dying.” At  p.m. Euler was gone. According to Condorcet, “he ceased to live and calculate.” The great mathematician was buried at the Smolensk cemetery next to the grave of his first wife. In , his ashes were transferred to the Necropolis at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. 
Leonhard Euler is the most prolific mathematician in history. Five hundred thirty books and articles were published during his lifetime. In , Enestrom¨ compiled a bibliography containing  titles. For over a hundred years, the Swiss Naturalists Society was publishing a collection of Euler’s works: seventy two volumes were published by the early s, with eight additional volumes of Euler’s scientific correspondences planned for publication. The very last of these volumes saw the light of day in .

Leonhard Euler’s triangles and elliptic curves 
Leonhard Euler left us with an immense legacy of works in mathematics, physics, and many other subjects, and much of modern mathematics starts with an idea of Euler. Here, we will focus on his celebrated paper on elemen tary geometry Easy solutions to some difficult geometric problems [], published in St. Petersburg in , on Euler’s return to Russia after a twenty-five-year stay in Berlin. This paper is the starting point for many theorems about trian gles that illustrate the beauty of mathematics in a way that is accessible to high school students. But it also inspired, as we shall see, interesting developments in algebraic geometry, where other ideas tracing back to Euler also play a role. 
Let us recall what the paper is about. Euler considers four centres of a triangle ABC: the orthocentre E (in Euler’s notation) is the intersection of the altitudes; the centroid or centre of gravity F is the intersection of medians; the incentre G and the circumcentre H are the centers of the inscribed and of the circumscribed circle, respectively. He shows that E, F, H lie on a line, which is now called the Euler line, and that EF : FH =2. He then shows how to reconstruct the triangle from any of the triangles EFG, EGH, FGH: out of the edge lengths of these triangles he constructs a cubic equation whose roots are the edge lengths of the original triangle. The property that the cubic equation must have three positive roots gives constraints on the distances between the centers, which he discusses in the case of the isosceles triangle. One of the con sequences of Euler’s calculations is the so-called Euler relation R2 − d2 = 2rR involving the distance d =GH between incentre and circumcentre and the radii r, R of the inscribed and of the circumscribed circle. From this relation the Euler inequality R≥2r readily follows. 
At this point we need to spoil the exposition with a necessary remark. Euler discusses various relations between distances in the triangle but does not explicitly consider the radius of the circumscribed circle. So, neither Euler’s relation nor Euler’s inequality appears in this paper. On the other hand, the inequality R ≥ 2r does appear in a  article of the British mathematician William Chapple [], published in a supplement to the Gentleman’s Magazine, albeit with a questionable proof. 
Certainly, the Euler line is in the paper, and it later turned out that other many further remarkable centers also lie on this line [], in particular the center of the Feuerbach nine-point-circle. But here we would like to follow

Euler’s line. 
another thread and for this we have to introduce another Swiss ´emigr´e in St. Petersburg. Euler’s sight had deteriorated since  to reach complete blindness by , so he invited the seventeen-year-old Nicolaus Fuss, who had studied with Daniel Bernoulli in Basel, to assist him in his work. Fuss partic ipated in the publication of more than  papers that Euler wrote between  and , the year of his (Euler’s) death. Fuss later married Euler’s grand daughter Albertine Euler, became an esteemed academician and contributed in various capacities to developing science and education in Russia. We owe him a moving biographical obituary of Euler. In  Fuss proves a theorem [] generalizing Euler’s relation to bicentric quadrilaterals: the distance d between the centers of the circumscribed and inscribed circles of a bicentric quadrilateral is related to their radii R, r by the formula 
(R2 − d2)2 = 2r2(R2 + d2). 
Incidentally, in the same volume of the Proceedings of the Academy there are still six articles by Euler, the last of which with the interesting title “Is  a prime number or not?” (it is not since, as Euler shows, it can be written as the sum of two squares in two different ways!). Fuss then tries to find a similar relation for polygons with more sides. In the  the volume of the Proceedings (four articles of Euler here) he publishes the solution to 
 Since the author of this text suspects that one of the reasons for asking him to write about Euler is that he is Swiss, he will unashamedly bias the exposition injecting a couple of further Swiss characters into the story.

Poncelet’s theorem. One conic is inscribed in a pentagon while the second conic is circumscribed about it. 
this problem for up to eight sides, but only in the special case where one vertex of the polygon is assumed to lie on the line connecting the centers of the two circles []. Jakob Steiner (another Swiss mathematician) poses the general problem in the second volume of Crelle’s Journal in  [] and gives then a solution without proof for up to eight sides (but omitting the heptagon). An interesting coincidence is that the paper following [] is Niels Abel’s “Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques” marking the beginning of the theory of elliptic curves, which turned out to be the key to solve the general case. 
Carl Gustav Jacobi tells this story in  [] and comments that Fuss incurred in the “unfortunately not frequent” error of formulating a claim in a special case, while it actually holds in the general case. Indeed, in the meantime, in , Poncelet’s book [] had appeared. In it, it is shown that if a pair of conic sections have the property that one is inscribed in a polygon and the other circumscribed about it, then there are infinitely many polygons with this property, and any point of the circumscribed conic can serve as a vertex. No Swiss connection here but a Russian one: Jean-Victor Poncelet participated in Napoleon’s Russian campaign (which some of the readers will know as the Patriotic War of ) and was captured at the Battle of Krasny. He wrote his book as a prisoner of war in Saratov between  and . 
Jacobi shows that Fuss’s equations are equivalent to Steiner’s and offers a general analytic solution for an arbitrary number of sides in terms of elliptic integrals. Later Arthur Cayley[] gave an algebraic solution, giving for each n an equation for the locus of pairs of conic sections admitting an n-sided polygon inscribed in one and circumscribed about the other. He uses the

theory of elliptic functions of Abel and Jacobi, but reminds us that his result is really a consequence of Euler’s addition formulae for elliptic integrals [, ]. An explanation of these results in modern terminology was given more recently by Phillip Griffiths and Joseph Harris [, , ]. Given two generic conic sections, they observe that the variety of pairs consisting of a point of the first conic and a line through it which is tangent to the second conic is a complex elliptic curve (which is topologically a torus S1 × S1) with two involu tions: one replaces the point by the other intersection point of the line with the first conic and the other replaces the tangent with the other tangent through the same point. The composition of these involutions is the translation by an element of the elliptic curve and we have a polygon if and only if this element has finite order. Thus, Cayley’s result can be understood as the description of the locus of points of finite order in a family of elliptic curves. The author’s interest in this story came from a recent result of Giovanni Gal lavotti and Ian Jauslin [] who reconsider a dynamical system introduced by Ludwig Boltzmann in : a particle in a plane subject to an attractive central force with an inverse-square law bounces elastically at a straight line not going through the center. As shown by Gallavotti and Jauslin, the system has, in addition to the energy, a second independent conserved quantity. It turns out [] that if for given values of the two conserved quantities one orbit is periodic, then all orbits with the same values of the conserved quantities are periodic. Again, an elliptic curve with two involutions provides the explanation of this phenomenon.

Gabriel Lame (––) ´ 
The French scientist Gabriel Lam´e was a mathematician, mechanic, engi neer, corresponding member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, and member of the Paris Academy of Sciences. He lived and worked in St. Peters burg from  to . His scientific interests took shape there: they covered a wide range of areas in mathematics and physics, from the number theory to the theory of elasticity and mathematical physics, from purely theoretical studies (such as the proof of Fermat’s theorem for n = 7) to very specific applications such as building suspension bridges. He developed the general theory of curvilinear coordinates. In coop 
eration with the French Embassy, St. Peters 
burg State University set up the Lam´e Chair 
in St. Petersburg, where French scientists can 
visit for three months. Gabriel Lam´e is one of 
the  scientists whose names are immortal 
ized on the Eiffel Tower. 
Gabriel Lam´e was born in Tours in west 
ern France. He received his primary educa 
tion at the Lyc´ee Louis-le-Grand in Paris. At 
, he had to leave the Lyc´ee and work as a 
petty clerk in a law firm. One day, he got 
his hands on a book by Legendre, Elements 
of Geometry, and was so fascinated that he 
returned to the Lyceum, successfully gradu 
ated, and entered the Ecole Polytechnique. ´ 
After that, he studied for another three years 
at the Ecole Nationale Sup ´ ´erieure des Mines 
de Paris (also known as Mines ParisTech), where he met and befriended the soon-to-be-famous physicist Emile Clapeyron (Benoit Paul ´ Emile Clapeyron), ´ with whom he was inseparable for many years. 
After the War of , great efforts were made in Russia to rebuild engi neering structures, buildings, and roads. There was a shortage of engineers, so teachers from the Institute of the Transport Engineers Corps, founded in , were sent off to various locations to supervise these projects. The director of the institute, Agustin Betancourt (he was from Spain), had to bring in Euro pean specialists as teachers. In , Pierre-Dominique Bazaine, a professor at
 Gabriel Lam´e 
the institute, went to France to invite two young promising engineers, and he chose Lam´e and Clapeyron. Tempted by the promise of many advantages and a high degree of freedom, they accepted the offer. 
Lam´e and Clapeyron gave lectures in higher mathe 
matics, physics, astronomy, mechanics and machine 
design, and applied chemistry. They also taught “A 
course in new discoveries and improvements in the 
arts.” Transport engineer Andrei Delvig recalled that 
Lam´e “was a decent man, deeply learned, of pleas 
ant appearance and graceful form, who lectured elo 
quently and was well versed in what he taught.” 
Lam´e’s scientific interests were related to the 
work carried out by the engineers of the insti 
tute: the construction of St. Isaac’s Cathedral, the 
St. Petersburg-Moscow road, chain bridges, etc. 
Lam´e took part in the construction of the Alexan 
der Column. In , the design for a .-meter 
high triumphal column in honor of Russia’s victory 
over Napoleon, submitted by Auguste de Montfer 
rand, was approved. For it to be pleasant to look 
at, the shape of the column was to be made slightly 
barrel-shaped. The line of curvature of the column, 
i.e., the outline of the outer contour, was calculated 
by Lam´e. He wrote: 
Taste, in accordance with the rules of art, 
requires that the column should gradually 
diminish in diameter as it rises in height and 
that this diminution should occur along a 
smooth curve. 
The column is made of a solid granite monolith 
and is supported by its own weight. Transporting 
and lifting it was also an engineering challenge. 
Even today, admiring the beauty and grandeur of 
the Alexander Column, one may recall Gabriel Lam´e 
and his “blessed choice of curvature,” using Montfer 
rand’s words. 
Lam´e and Clapeyron developed the designs for 
suspension bridges over the Yauza River, the Moscow 
River, and the Luga River in Yamburg. They wrote 
several papers on suspension bridges and the con 
struction of rope polygons. Lam´e and Clapeyron are 
believed to have pioneered the ideas of graphostatics, introducing the concept of the rope polygon as a tool of investigation. Related to problems in the

theory of elasticity, Lam´e also worked on the theory of series, in particular the Fourier series. Under the influence of Ostrogradsky, Lam´e took an interest in the problem of heat propagation. This is evidenced by his article on the laws of cooling and solidification of a liquid sphere, published in  (Ann. Chim. et Phys., V. . P. ––). Modern researchers believe it to have been the first work in the theory of free boundary problems. 
Lam´e was also interested in railway construction. In , he was sent to the inauguration of the Liverpool and Manchester railway to learn from the experience of its construction. He was awarded the rd class of the Order of Saint Stanislaus for his report on the trip. 
After eleven years of a successful career in Russia, Lam´e nevertheless de cided to leave. The exact reason for his return is still unknown, but it may have been the July Revolution in France in , which made the Russian government suspicious of the French. Lam´e himself (a Saint-Simon supporter) was uncomfortable with the political situation that developed during the reign of Nicholas I in Russia. Lam´e’s letters also help us understand the reasons for his abrupt departure. As early as , he wrote: 
French families are leaving Russia. Our social circle is shrinking drasti cally, and unless we fit in with Russian society, which does not suit us and which we are not suited to, our salon will turn into a desert. This prospect does not frighten me. I like solitude enough. But my wife, who does not have math to work hard on, and who cannot even spend time with her husband when he is working, is perfectly entitled to start complaining, and that worries me. 
In , Lam´e, a professor, a major in the Russian service, and a correspond ing member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, resigned (officially, due
 Gabriel Lam´e 
to illness) and returned to Paris. While working in Russia, Lam´e published  papers on mathematics, structural mechanics, theoretical mechanics, and applied mechanics. His writings show that the main scientific fields to which Lam´e devoted his later life, such as the theory of elasticity, the analytic theory of heat, and the theory of curvilinear coordinates, were outlined in St. Peters burg. It was in Russia that he obtained his first results in mathematical physics. 
After his departure from Russia, Lam´e remained engaged in railway con struction for several years. Together with Clapeyron, he drew up the first prospective plan for the railway network in France, and after some time, they started building the Paris-Saint-Germain railroad. 
Lam´e soon abandoned his engineering career, however. In , he began teaching physics at the Ecole Polytechnique, then lectured at the Sorbonne. In the following decades, he produced major works in mathematical physics that made him famous. 
Lam´e announced a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem at the same time as Augustin Louis Cauchy. Both had been publishing their supposed proofs in parts until Ernst Kummer pointed out an error they both had in common: Lam´e and Cauchy assumed the unique factorization property (factoriality) for some rings for which it did not actually hold.

In , Lam´e was forced to abandon his work due to hearing loss. His last years were difficult. Andrei Delvig recalled that he saw Lam´e shortly before his death, quite old, deaf, and sickly, but Lam´e “spoke with pleasure of his time in Russia and remembered it with gratitude.”

Mikhail Vasilyevich Ostrogradsky (––) 
Mikhail Ostrogradsky had a significant influence on the teaching of math ematics in the military and engineering schools of the Russian Empire. He solved the wave propagation problem in a cylindrical basin, obtained a for mula for transforming the integral over a three-dimensional body into an integral over its surface, introduced the notion of a conjugate operator, and studied variational principles, including those 
in non-conservative mechanical systems. 
He was born on September  (September 
 Old Style)  on his father’s estate in 
Poltava province and lived in the countryside 
with his parents until he was eight years old. His 
younger brother Andrei recollected that from 
childhood Mikhail liked to measure everything, 
from frogs to the depth of a well, and used to 
carry around a piece of string with him all the 
time for that purpose. 
In , Mikhail entered Poltava Gymna 
sium. At the same time, according to the custom 
of Russian nobility, Ostrogradsky was enlisted 
into public service in the Poltava governor’s of 
fice. Later, Ostrogradsky was prepared to enter 
Kharkov University, though he dreamed of a mil 
itary career, and in  he became a university 
student. Under the influence of a keen mathematics teacher, Andrei Pavlovsky, he began to work diligently on the textbooks by himself and in  he passed the examinations for the three-year course of study. Then, on his own petition, he left the university with a certificate to enter military service. 
A year later, however, Ostrogradsky returned to the university “for im provement in the sciences pertaining to applied mathematics.” He suffered in the conflict between the rector Timofei Osipovsky, mathematician and ma terialist, and the new trustee of the university Zachary Korneev, who came “to dispel the gloom of delusion, established by the conceit of reason, and to plant Christian virtues in the hearts.” Ostrogradsky did not attend lectures

on Divine Law. The teacher wrote a complaint to the trustee who forwarded it to the minister of education. As a result, Ostrogradsky was punished “for freethinking”: deprived not only of a candidate degree awarded to him in April  but also of the diploma of . 
Soon, to get better at mathematics, Ostrogradsky asked his father to let him go to France. In a quiet province, such trips were considered very dangerous at the time, as Ostrogradsky’s biographers mention; relatives and neighbors thought the young man was being sent to his death and that his father, having given permission, had lost his mind. In autumn , Ostrogradsky (on the second attempt, because the first time he was robbed by a fellow traveler) reached Paris where he attended several courses in mathematics with Pierre Simon Laplace, Joseph Fourier, and Augustin-Louis Cauchy. There is little information about his stay in Paris. He did not keep diaries; his correspon dence was sparse and uninteresting, mainly containing requests for money. In his first letter, he wrote that he had already toured the entire city, the city is lovely, but its beauties are exaggerated, the carriages are very bad and usually harnessed with two horses. 
In November , Ostrogradsky presented his first work, Memoir on Wave Propagation in a Cylindrical Vessel, to the Paris Academy of Sciences. It was printed in . There are two versions of why he wrote this work. The first one is that Ostrogradsky wandered alone along the banks of the Seine and, being bored, watched the movement of waves which inspired him to study wave motion. According to the second one, in , he did not get money from his father in time for some reason, and since he owed money for the hotel and food, on the complaint of his host, he was put in the debtor’s prison in Clichy, where he wrote the paper. Ostrogradsky sent it to Cauchy, who presented it to the Paris Academy of Sciences with a most flattering review, and that was why it was printed in France. Moreover, Cauchy himself bought Ostrogradsky out of prison.In Paris, Mikhail Ostrogradsky became close with Viktor Bunyakovsky. 
With time, his father stopped sending him money altogether, so Ostrograd sky had to return to Russia at the beginning of , and on foot at that — he was robbed again on the way. The fact that he had been in France, where he could have breathed in the revolutionary spirit, most likely explains the secret police surveillance that he was under for some time on his return, which lasted until it became clear that he did not have any political agenda. 
He submitted several papers to the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. These works, along with his popularity in France, led to Mikhail Ostrogradsky being elected an adjunct of the Academy of Science on December , . 
 Cauchy, a strong supporter of Jesuits and member of the Society of St Vincent, did as he had been taught, i.e., he ransomed a pauper from prison because Ostrogradsky had committed no crimes, but he was poor. Cauchy helped Ostrogradsky obtain a place in the college of Henry IV, which allowed the young scholar to improve his financial situation.
 Mikhail Vasilyevich Ostrogradsky 
By that time, three of his works on mathematical physics and mathematical analysis had been published in the Academy publications. In August , Ostrogradsky was elected Extraordinary Academician and a year later Ordi nary Academician in Applied Mathematics, and in , after the death of Academician Pavel Fuss, he took up the chair of Ordinary Academician in Pure Mathematics. Mikhail Ostrogradsky took an active part in the life of the Academy: he wrote scientific papers, made reports, and reviewed the submitted works. However, most of his time was devoted to pedagogical work, to which he gave more than  years of his life. 
Although Ostrogradsky remained in St. Petersburg, his influence was quite tangible throughout Russia. In , he submitted a report to the Academy of Sciences in which he defined his goal: to promote applying theoretical knowledge to practical needs. This position was most clearly reflected in the higher engineering schools of St. Petersburg. Ostrogradsky taught at the Naval Cadet Corps (from ), the Institute of the Transport Engineers Corps (from ), the Main Pedagogical Institute (from ), the Main Engineering School (from ), and the Main Artillery School (from ). 
In , Ostrogradsky gave his first course in mechanics in St. Petersburg. It was a series of public lectures on celestial mechanics in which he generalized the methods underlying Lagrange’s analytical mechanics. The course lasted from November  to March . Despite the high cost of the course,  people attended the lectures. To put the number into context: the subscription cost one hundred roubles, while in the s wheat flour cost up to  roubles per pood ( kg), a cartload of hay — up to  roubles, a hundred eggs — . roubles. 
The Institute of Transport Engineers bought five subscriptions to these lec tures and made them available to the institute’s assistants. One of them, Ignaty Yanushevsky, an institute graduate in , recorded these lectures. In the report to the director of the institute on the necessity to publish the lectures, Yanushevsky wrote []: 
Ostrogradsky’s course by the novelty and generality of ideas it contains would be respected not only in Russia, but also abroad, and most of all it would be useful for our officers, who, after leaving the institute, the best institution in terms of mathematics in Russia, often have neither time nor means to follow new discoveries. 
These lectures by Ostrogradsky were lithographed in French, see the illustra tion on page . It could be said that they have reached out to us thanks to Yanushevsky. 
Ostrogradsky gave various courses in mathematical sciences. At the Naval Cadet Corps (later the Naval Academy), he led mathematics and descriptive geometry classes. In addition to compulsory courses, Ostrogradsky read Al gebraic and Transcendental Analysis. The lectures were public and attracted quite a lot of attendees — more than  people. The notes of these lectures

were published in . When he joined the Main Pedagogical Institute, Ostro gradsky emphasized that mathematics should be taught at least thrice weekly. The scholar compiled his own course and needed an assistant to repeat the material there. These requirements were met. Among Ostrogradsky’s most prominent pupils from the Pedagogical Institute were Ivan Vyshnegradsky, Alexander Tikhomandritsky, Nikolai Budaev, Petr Roshchin, Egor Sabinin, Daniil Delarue, and others. 
One of Ostrogradsky’s favorite educational institutions was the Institute of Transport Engineers Corps. He was invited there in  to teach mechanics, along with the famous mathematician Viktor Bunyakovsky. The letter from
 Mikhail Vasilyevich Ostrogradsky 
the chief manager of transport routes to the rector of the institute stated: “I order Your Excellency to invite two adjuncts of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, Ostrogradsky and Bunyakovsky. The former will teach analytical mechanics and astronomy, and the latter will teach differential and integral calculus and synthetic statics” []. At the institute, mathematical education was always paramount. Thus, at the session of the conference (council) of the institute in , the following resolution was adopted: “Higher mathematics should be ranked to the first category of sciences, i.e., to the sciences every en gineer needs.” The provision of  states rather tellingly: “Those engineers, who do not master higher mathematics, should not be graduated as engineers, only as architects.” 
In , at the meeting of the Institute’s Council, it was noted that “the urge for analysis is learned by them (students) through the study of higher mathematical sciences” []. The point here is that engineers take a responsible approach to the assigned task, carefully analyze it, and only then make deci sions. It was the students of this institute who recorded Ostrogradsky’s lectures on celestial mechanics in  and on analytical mechanics in  and . The latter, the third lithographed course by Academician Mikhail Ostrogradsky of , is less well known. A copy of the course is kept only in the scientific and technical library of The Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University (formerly the Institute of the Transport Engineers Corps). The comparison of Ostrogradsky’s lectures, published twenty years apart, allows us to trace the dynamics of the development of analytical mechanics. 
Mikhail Ostrogradsky quickly gained exceptional authority as a scientist, lecturer, and educator. Valerian Panaev, a graduate of the institute in  and a famous engineer, left interesting memoirs about the institute, its professors and scientists. He wrote: “Every pupil was eagerly looking forward to the hap piness and achieving the great honor of listening to lectures of Ostrogradsky... The clarity and brevity of his expositions were amazing. He did not torture the listener with calculations but constantly kept him in an alert state regarding the essence of the question” []. Ostrogradsky stimulated listeners’ work in mathematics and mechanics by his mere presence, the effect of which could be seen in a large number of papers and translations produced by students of Ostrogradsky in the s––s “at the behest of the soul” (i.e., of their own volition) kept in the archives []. 
Transport engineer Alexander Durnovo wrote []: 
Hardly any other professor has been the subject of as many stories, anec dotes, and legends as Ostrogradsky. And he was really original and peculiar... M.V.’s presentation of his subject was excellent — precise, clear, and even artistic. He never repeated himself, and if he had to speak sometimes about something he had already explained before, he always did it in a new way, with new arguments and new methods of making conclusions. Often, he got carried away, and always in one direction —
Mikhail Vasilyevich Ostrogradsky  
into the field of military history. Fascinatingly, with great enthusiasm, he explained to his listeners the exploits of the great generals, making chalk drawings ... and proving the strong correlation between a commander’s talent and his mathematical mindset. 
By decree of Nicholas I, an Educational Committee was established in November  to determine priorities in technical education and to oversee “its progress in the educational institutions under the Ministry of Transport” []. At the time, these educational institutions included the Institute of Trans port Engineers Corps, the Civil Engineering College, and various schools. In December , Mikhail Ostrogradsky was elected a member of the committee and was appointed the primary supervisor for mathematical science teaching in the military schools of St. Petersburg and the educational institutions un der the Ministry of Transport. His responsibilities included considering new programs and teaching methods, new guidelines for all academic subjects, reviewing books and textbooks purchased for the schools, and selecting the teaching staff. Given that Ostrogradsky taught in five St. Petersburg schools and was associated with Moscow University and the Moscow Technical Col lege (now the Bauman Moscow State Technical University), his influence on teaching mathematics can hardly be overestimated. 
Indeed, Ostrogradsky’s ideas spread throughout the country. For example, his students from the Main Pedagogical Institute, where “professor Ostrograd sky, using his own notes, taught higher algebra, differential, integral calculus, and calculus of variations, analytic geometry, and the theory of mechanics with applications” [], received appointments at the institutions of the Min istry of Public Education in St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Caucasus, Derpt (now Tartu in Estonia), Belarus, Kiev, and Kazan educational districts as well as in various gymnasiums and colleges in Siberia and the Urals. His pupils from other educational institutions also moved all over the country. 
To give a more complete picture of Mikhail Ostrogradsky’s multifaceted activities, one might point out his work on various expert committees. For example, in , he was a member of committees on the consideration of projects for the water supply of St. Petersburg “using passage pipes,” on the research of firing “regulated grenades,” and on review of the experiments of academician Boris Jacobi (Moritz Hermann von Jacobi) for the “application of electromagnetic force to movement of ships” (and other means of transport). 
Ostrogradsky’s scientific works pertain to analytical mechanics, fluid me chanics, the theory of elasticity, celestial mechanics, mathematical analysis, and differential equations. In analytical mechanics, his results are related to developing the principle of virtual displacements, variational principles of me chanics, and other problems. The theory of heat propagation in liquids was in fact first constructed by Ostrogradsky. A number of formulas and methods are named after him. Mikhail Ostrogradsky was also concerned with the theory of
 Mikhail Vasilyevich Ostrogradsky 
magnetism as well as with problems of the calculus of variations, integration of algebraic functions, number theory, algebra, geometry, and probability theory. He was friends with the great Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, and there is evidence that the latter lived in Ostrogradsky’s flat after his return from exile. Mikhail loved the Ukrainian culture and often used Ukrainian words in everyday speech and lectures. Not wishing to puzzle out inarticulately written works of Lobachevsky (Gauss compared them to a thick forest, through which one cannot find the way without examining every tree first), Ostrogradsky gave a negative review of them. After his mother’s death, Mikhail Ostrograd sky resumed participating in church services. 
In , Mikhail Ostrogradsky was elected a foreign member of the Amer ican Academy of Arts and Sciences, of the Turin Academy in , of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Rome in , and of the Paris Academy of Sciences as a corresponding foreign member in . 
Mikhail Ostrogradsky died on st January  (th December  Old Style) of a tumor in his back; he was buried in his ancestral manor. Aleksei Krylov wrote: 
The sturdiness of Mikhail Vasilievich’s body could be envied by Taras Bulba himself, for even the then septic surgery and semi-shamanic medicine needed four months to bring him to the grave.

Gauss–Green–Ostrogradsky divergence theorem 
The divergence theorem may be classically formulated as follows: Let A be a bounded connected open set with (piecewise) smooth boundary ∂A in Rn, n≥1, and f =( f1, f2, …, fn) a smooth vector field in an open set containing the closure 

of A. We haveZ A 
div f dHn = − 
Z 
∂A 
f ·νdHn−1, () 

where ν is the interior unit normal to ∂A, Hkis the k−dimensional Hausdorff measure and div f :=Pni=1Difi, Di:=∂∂xi. Recall that, for any positive real number k, Hkallows us to measure any set in Rnand, for integral k’s, it agrees with Lebesgue’s k−dimensional measure on smooth k−dimensional surfaces in Rn. 
In -dimension, equation () simply reads as R baf dx = f (b) − f (a); in any dimension it is equivalent, i =1, …, n, to 

Z 
A 
Dif dHn = − 
Z

f νi dHn−1. () 

In particular, () trivially holds if A is a product of n bounded intervals. Finally, from () yields RADif dx = 0 for any f with compact support in A, hence the 

following duality formulaZ A 
Dif φ dHn = − 
Z

fDiφ dHn() 

whenever f , φ are smooth functions in A and φ has compact support in A. The divergence theorem goes also under the names of Gauss, Ostrograd sky, Green and combinations such as Gauss–Green’s or Gauss–Ostrogradsky’s theorem. This is not surprising since special cases may be traced back to the beginning or early periods of multidimensional calculus, and credits are often misplaced. A reference for the history of the divergence theorem is []. In the th century both Lagrange and Laplace used the fundamental theorem of calculus and iteration to reduce domain integrals into boundary integrals. Special cases of () occur in the papers of Gauss in , , and . In  Mikhail Ostrogradsky presented a paper to the Paris Academy of

Sciences where he formulated and proved the divergence theorem in dimen sion ; similarly he did in a paper presented to the Paris Academy in  and to the St. Petersburg Academy in . The last presentation was the only one published in ; the other two survived only in manuscript form. 
The divergence theorem also appears in a paper of Poisson presented in  and published in  without reference to Ostrogradsky, though there seems to be evidence that Poisson had seen Ostrogradsky’s paper. In the same year , Green published privately a paper, that remained unnoticed for quite some time, where he used formulas of the type 

Z 
A 
(u ∆v + Du · Dv) dV = 
Z 
∂A 
u∂v∂νdS 

in  dimensions, formulas nowadays named Green’s identities; instead, there is no explicit mention of what we call Green’s theorem: 

Z 
C 
(L dx + M dy) = ± 
Z 
 
D 
∂x −∂L 
∂M 
∂ y 
 dxdy 

where C is a closed curve in R2and D the enclosed domain. Such a formula appears, instead, without proof in a paper of Cauchy, , and later with proof in the inaugural dissertation of Riemann, , in relation to Cauchy’s theorem for functions of complex variables. 
Finally, it is worth mentioning the connection between Ostrogradsky– Gauss–Green formulas and Stokes’ formula 

Z S 
(curlσ) dA = ± 
Z Γ 
(σ ·τ) ds 

where ds is the element of length of the boundary curve Γ of a surface S in R3and τ is the unit tangent vector to Γ , the sign depending on orientation. A long process — involving many mathematicians, in particular Ostrogradsky, Hankel, Volterra, Poincar´e, and Elie Cartan — leads to the Stokes theorem for differential forms: For smooth oriented (k + 1)−surfaces S and k−differential 

forms ω we have:Z S 
dω = 
Z 
∂S 
ω. () 

Special instances of this are: Stokes’s theorem when ω is a -form in -space, Green’s theorem when ω is a -form in -space and the divergence theorem when ω is a -form in -space. 
The previous theorems are both technically and conceptually relevant in mathematical analysis, geometry, and physics. Of the enormous pertinent literature, I will illustrate here only some aspects of the theory of sets of finite perimeter that De Giorgi developed in a series of papers starting in early , see []. As general references for proofs and more, I refer the reader to [], [], and [].
Gauss–Green–Ostrogradsky divergence theorem  
Points of the reduced boundary of a Caccioppoli set and the associated normal are identified by a measure-theoretic blow-up procedure. 
Let E be a Lebesgue-measurable set in Rn, n≥1. According to De Giorgi, E is a set of finite perimeter or a Caccioppoli set if the distributional derivatives of its characteristic function (or indicatrix), χE, are signed Radon measures µi. 
This means, according to the duality formula (), that RχEDiψdx =−Rψdµi, for every smooth ψ with compact support, the µ0is being signed Radon measures; equivalently, according to Riesz theorem, that the linear map 
λ(φ) :=RχEdiv φ dHnis equibounded for |φ| ≤ 1. Writing DiχEfor µi and |DχE| for thetotal variation of the vector-valued measure DχE, that is the measure that at every Borel set B takes the value 

sup
  Z B 
div φ 
   φ ∈ C1c(Rn, Rn), |φ(x)| ≤ 1 a.e. , 

the perimeter of E is then defined as the total variation |DχE| evalued at Rn P(E) := |DχE|(Rn). 
From now on, I shall denote by P the class of Caccioppoli sets. From () one easily infers that bounded sets A with smooth boundaries of finite Hn−1 measure are in P, and P(A) = Hn−1(∂A) holds. For a generic E ∈P we know from the theory of differentiation of measures that at |DχE|-a.e. x there exists the Radon–Nikodym derivative of DχE with respect to |DχE| 

dDχE 
d|DχE|= lim r→0+ 
DχE(B(x, r)) 
|DχE(B(x, r))|=: ν(x, E). () 

Therefore, for any φ ∈C1c(Rn, Rn) we can write 

Z E 
div φ dHn = − 
Z 
φ ·ν(x, E) |DχE| () 

and even take the second integral over ∂E, since the support of |DχE| lies in ∂E. Formula () sounds like the extension of the divergence theorem to Caccioppoli sets. But it is not precisely so, because there are sets for which P(E) < ∞ but Hn−1(∂E) = ∞ (see Fig. ), and we are missing a relation be tween boundary and ν(x, E).

defined as the set of points at which ν(x, E) exists and |ν(x, E)|=1; we have: ∂−E is (n − 1)−rectifiable, that is, apart from a Hn−1-zero set, ∂−E is the union of Borel sets of (n − 1)−dimensional manifolds with tangent planes normal to ν(x, E) for Hn−1 − a.e. x ∈∂−E, moreover 
DχE = ν(x, E)Hn−1|∂−E, 
and the divergence theorem holds in the form: 

Z E

φ ·ν(x, E) dHn−1. 

Furthermore, we have ∂−E ⊂ ∂µE where ∂µE is the measure-theoretic boundary of E, consisting of the points which are neither of density one (rarefaction points) for E nor of density zero for E (rarefaction points for the complement of E), and, moreover, Hn−1(∂µE \ ∂−E)=0. Finally, a theorem of Federer states that E is a Caccioppoli set if and only if Hn−1(∂µE)<∞. 
The class of Caccioppoli sets and the perimeter enjoy a number of func tional properties. By definition, (i) the perimeter P(E) is lower semicontinuous with respect to the convergence in mean, that is, the convergence of the indica trices in L1. Moreover, one proves (ii) approximation: for every E ∈P there is a sequence of sets Ej ∈P that are polygonal (a set is polygonal if its boundary is contained in finitely many hyperplanes) or bounded with smooth boundaries, such that the E0js converge in mean to E and P(Ej)→ P(E); (iii) compactness: from a sequence of sets in P with equibounded perimeters and supports we may choose a subsequence that converges in mean to a set in P. 
An approximation to a Caccioppoli set that has everywhere dense boundary; an example of such a set is given by the union of circles with centers at all rational points in the unit square.
Gauss–Green–Ostrogradsky divergence theorem  
Therefore, we may think of Caccioppoli sets as of the limits in mean of sets with smooth boundaries and of the perimeter as of Lebesgue’s extension of the classical measure of the boundary: 

¦ 
P(E) := inf
j→∞P(Ej) lim inf

, 

where the infimum is taken among sequences of sets Ej with smooth bound aries converging to E in mean. This distinguishes the class of Caccioppoli sets as the natural class in which to study variational problems involving the area of codimension one surfaces. One such problem is that of finding a set of minimum perimeter among sets of prescribed full measure, which has a simple positive answer in the class P, and then characterize the optimal sets as hyperspheres, which is the isoperimetric property of the hypersphere in its dual form: Denote by C a hypersphere in Rn; then P(E) ≥ P(C) for all E ∈ P with Hn(E)=Hn(C), moreover equality holds if and only if E =C. 
A rough presentation of De Giorgi’s proof of the isoperimetric property of the hypersphere follows. 
. Steiner’s symmetrization procedure, which classically preserves the full measure and decreases the boundary measure of smooth sets, extends to Caccioppoli sets. 
Given a bounded set E ∈P and a direction η in R, let H be (n − 1)−plane orthogonal to η. I recall that Steiner symmetrization of E in the direction η is the set Es,ηenjoying the property that its intersection with (almost) any straight line L orthogonal to H is a segment, symmetric about H, the length of which equals the 1−dimensional measure of L ∩ H. The following holds: Hn(Es,η) = Hn(E) and P(Es,η) ≤ P(E); moreover, if equality holds, then E is normal with respect to H or in the direction η, that is, the intersections of straight lines orthogonal to H with E are segments. 
. On the account of the approximation theorem, to prove that P(B)≥ P(C) for all B∈P with Hn(B)=Hn(C) it suffices to prove it in case B is a polygonal set Π. If so, Π is enclosed in a large ball B(0, R) and, by compactness and semicontinuity, the perimeter has a minimizer in the class E of sets B∈P with Hn(B) = Hn(Π) and supports in B(0, R). Let E be one of such minimizers. Steiner symmetrized Es,ηis also a minimizer in the same class E, hence E is normal in the direction η. Since this holds for all directions and all minimizers, we conclude that every minimizer is normal with respect to any direction or every minimizer is convex. 
. Let E be a bounded and convex set and let H be an (n −1)−plane passing throught the barycenter of E. After a rotation we may assume that H is the hyperplane xn = 0 and we may represent E, by setting ( y, xn) instead of (x1, …, xn), as the set f1( y)≤ xn ≤ f2( y), y ∈ D, where D is a convex domain
 Gauss–Green–Ostrogradsky divergence theorem in Rn−1and f1, f2 are Lipschitz functions. One also sees that

According to Minkowski’s inequality we then infer P(E) − P(Es,xn ) ≥ 0 and equality holds if and only if D( f1 − f2)=0 in D. This yields that E is symmetric in any direction, hence E is a hypersphere. 
In particular, we have proved that the sphere is the unique solution to the problem of finding a set of smallest perimeter among sets of given full measure with smooth boundaries. 
In the classical context, De Giorgi’s proof may be read as: If the set E is optimal, then E is a sphere. This essentially amounts to what Steiner did and believed to be a proof of the isoperimetric property of the sphere. In the measure theoretic context the existence of a solution is proved, in Steiner’s classical context it is assumed. 
As we know nowadays, this makes Steiner’s proof not complete: before accusing somebody of murder, having excluded everybody else, it is better to be sure that we are in a case of murder. By assuming the existence of certain objects, one may in fact prove all kind of nonsense. 
According to Perron, assuming that there is a largest positive integer, n, we may prove that n must be ; in fact if n were larger than , then n2 > n, con tradiction. Steiner never accepted that his proof of the isoperimetric property was incomplete, although Dirichlet pointed out the gap to him. The irony of history is that in the nineteenth century distinguished mathematicians such as Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann, Neumann, made a similar error, see [].

Viktor Bunyakovsky was a Russian mathematician, demographer, member of the Academy of Sciences (), and its vice-president ––. He made significant contributions to the development of probability theory and statis tics, and actively participated in the establishment and subsequent reforms of mathematical education in the Russian Empire. 
He was born in the town of Bar, Podolsk Governorate, into the family of a lieutenant colonel of cavalry, who died in Finland during the Russian-Swedish war of ––. Having lost his father at an 
early age, Bunyakovsky was brought up in the 
family of General Count Alexander Tormasov, a 
participant in the Patriotic War of . 
In , together with Tormasov’s son 
Alexander, Bunyakovsky went abroad to study. 
He studied in Coburg in Bavaria, where he took 
private lessons, then at the Academy in Lau 
sanne, before moving to Paris to study at the 
Coll`ege de France and the Faculty of Sciences 
of the Sorbonne (––). He attended lec 
tures by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Pierre-Simon 
Laplace, Joseph Fourier, Sim´eon Denis Pois 
son, Adrien-Marie Legendre, and Andr´e-Marie 
Amp`ere. In Paris, he was awarded bachelor’s 
and licentiate degrees (), and in , he 
received a doctorate in mathematics for his work on analytical dynamics and the theory of heat. He became friends there with Mikhail Ostrogradsky. After returning to Russia, Bunyakovsky taught at the First Cadet Corps (––) and St. Petersburg University (––). He was a professor at the Mining Institute and the Institute of Transport Engineers Corps. In , he became an Extraordinary Academician, and in , he was elected vice president of the Academy of Sciences and held this position until his death. Bunyakovsky investigated particular issues of integration and elementary number theory and wrote a historical review of various “proofs” of the parallel postulate. He did not accept Lobachevsky’s theory, although he spoke of it

with respect. Bunyakovsky’s main achievements were in probability theory, statistics, and demography. 
Having reworked the lectures of Laplace that he had listened to in Paris, Bunyakovsky wrote the best textbook of its time, Foundations of Mathematical Probability Theory (). 
Bunyakovsky mainly was concerned with applied issues of demography and insurance; however, he did influence Pafnuty Chebyshev in the field of probability theory. The mathematical foundations of insurance in Russia had already been laid by Leonhard Euler and Nicolas Fuss, whom Bunyakovsky refers to in his papers. From , Bunyakovsky was the government’s chief expert on statistics and insurance and helped organize a retired insurance saving association in the navy, an organization to which members contributed money (usually % of their salary) and from which an annual pension was paid to a member or (in case of his death) his family members after a certain period of participation or time in service. 
The rational planning of the old-age insurance saving association required an understanding of how much and what payments were to be made, on average: Bunyakovsky investigated relevant mathematical models. In , he published a series of four notes on the subject. In Notes on a Question About Life Pensions, read at the meeting of the Physics and Mathematics Division of the Academy of Sciences on December , , he gave a mathematical solution to the problem of how to “determine the age X, at the reaching of which a person becomes entitled to a pension, conditioning that age so that the annually increasing total of pensioners would not exceed some given limit with time.” Mathematician Andrei Markov participated in  in the calculations for the association, for which he was issued a commendation from the Ministry of Finance. Incidentally, Markov, a gymnasium student, wrote a letter to Bunyakovsky. The latter found some mistakes in Markov’s research but did praise the future academician. 
The mortality records of the Orthodox population were practically the only source of demographic data available at the time (there were no censuses); it was from these that Bunyakovsky had to calculate the age distribution of Russia’s population. Having studied the issue, Bunyakovsky concluded: 
Our extremely unfavorable situation regarding mortality laws in compar ison with other European nations, which is still accepted as an undoubted fact, in my opinion, is simply a scientific misunderstanding, which arose and was retained solely because those who addressed this issue did not go deep enough into its essence. 
The old mortality table method exaggerated mortality for a country with an increasing population. Considering it erroneous, Bunyakovsky proposed a new method of compiling mortality tables. The difference between his method and the previous one was that the numbers of deaths by age were compared

with the number of births of the generation to which the deaths of that age belonged. 
Bunyakovsky calculated, among other things, the probable size of the Rus sian army. In those days, such a value could only be estimated using statistics. He also gained fame as an inventor. In , he invented new models of pantographs (devices that make scaled-down copies of drawings and maps), planimeters (devices that measure areas), and the so-called ´equerre, which proved to be more accurate and cheaper than their existing equivalents. The summing ´equerre was designed to use the method of least squares: by moving 
rulers and clamping screws, one could obtain px2 + y2 from the numbers x, y, which made it possible to calculate the sum of the squares of the given numbers quickly. 
In , building on the working principle of the traditional Russian aba cus, Bunyakovsky invented “self-count,” a device for repeatedly adding and subtracting large numbers. Self-counts were to calculate the average monthly or annual values of meteorological elements: for example, instead of dividing the sum by , each summand was counted with the factor /. The original self-counts have survived only in The Polytechnic Museum and The National Museum of the Republic of Karelia. 
In , Viktor Bunyakovsky, together with Pafnuty Chebyshev and Vasily Imshenetsky, got Sofia Kovalevskaya elected to the Academy of Sciences. Thus, she became the first woman among the corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences.

Chebyshev’s era
Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev (––) 
Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshevis the founder of the th-century Russian mathematical school in Saint Petersburg. He contributed to number theory, probability, approximation theory, analysis, geometry, algebra, differential equations, abelian integrals, cartography, and 
astronomy. His results on the distribution of 
prime numbers stand as the basis of analytic 
number theory. His work on probability in 
cludes significant extensions of the law of large 
numbers and of the central limit theorem, and 
makes him one of the principal founders of 
modern probability theory. He was the first 
mathematician to recognize the importance of 
a general theory of orthogonal polynomials. We 
owe him fundamental results on the approxima 
tion of a real analytic function by polynomials. 
He had a very strong interest in mechanical en 
gineering and conceived several machines and 
devices. His work highlights the importance of mathematics in the applied sciences, and conversely, it shows how practical problems may motivate theo retical research. 
Pafnuty Chebyshev was born on May , , in the village of Okatovo, about  km south of Moscow, district of Borovsk, Kaluga province. The village was a part of the property of his father, a former army officer of noble descent. Chebyshev received his education at home until age , first from family members and then private tutors. In , he enrolled in the faculty of physics and mathematics of Moscow University. One year later, he wrote a paper titled Calculation of the roots of equations in which he gave a method of approximation for the roots of an algebraic equation of degree n. This was the first of a series of works he published in approximation theory, a topic in which he became engaged for the rest of his life. 
At Moscow University, Chebyshev’s talents attracted the attention of N. D. Brashman, his teacher of Mechanics who became his mentor and for

whom Chebyshev always retained a profound respect, both as a mathematician and a person. He graduated in  with a candidate dissertation titled On the numerical solution of algebraic equations of higher degree. In , he published the first of a series of  papers that appeared in Liouville’s journal (Journal de math´ematiques pures et appliqu´ees). This paper, entitled Note on a class of multiple definite integrals, attracted the attention of Eug`ene Charles Catalan even before its publication, since the latter wrote a sequel to Chebyshev’s re sults which was published in the same issue of the journal. In , Chebyshev published a paper in Crelle’s journal (Journal fur die reine und angewandte ¨ Mathematik), titled Note on the convergence of Taylor’s series, in which he pointed out a gap in a statement by A.-L. Cauchy involving the integration of a series of functions. In , he defended a Magister thesis, titled An attempt for an elementary analysis of the theory of probability, opening up a series of works on a topic in which he became a world leader. 
In , Chebyshev settled in Saint Petersburg where he started to teach at the Imperial University. In , he defended a doctoral dissertation on number theory, titled The theory of congruences, concerning a topic in which he became interested after reading Leonhard Euler’s works. According to B. N. Delone [], this dissertation contained the first non-trivial results on the distribution of prime numbers since the works of Euclid, and their importance is only comparable to those obtained by Bernhard Riemann on this topic. Part of this thesis was published in  in Liouville’s journal under the title On the function which determines the totality of prime numbers smaller than a certain limit. It contains new results on the growth and the limiting behavior of the function φ(x) of the number of primes less than x for large x, incidentally in validating several statements made by Legendre and giving alternative results and proofs. By then, Chebyshev had become a highly respected mathematician in Europe, and his prestige and influence increased. 
Motivated by the steam engine constructed by James Watt in , Cheby shev published a paper titled On the theory of mechanisms, known under the name of parallelograms in . This was the first of around ten papers he wrote on the theory of mechanical linkages. Roughly speaking, Watt produced a mechanism that, from a combination of circular motions, produces a recti linear one. Chebyshev was interested in this question because it involves the conception of mechanical devices and approximation theory. He also wanted to obtain an exact solution to the problem of transforming a rectilinear motion into a circular one, not only approximations. The problem was solved in  by Yom Tov Lipman Lipkin, one of his young collaborators, and two years later it was given another solution by the French engineer Charles-Nicolas Peaucellier []. In his work on this topic, Chebyshev inaugurated the general study of transforming one motion into another one through mechanical link ages. By the end of the th century, interest in the theory of linkages had declined. Still, it became very active again in the s, under the impulse of

William Thurston: see the survey by Alexei Sossinsky []. Among the devices that Chebyshev invented are mechanical linkages for a wheelchair and for a rowing boat. Incidentally, it is in his  paper on linkages that the Chebyshev polynomials appeared for the first time. 
Chebyshev was fluent in French, which was not unusual among th century educated Russians. In the early s, he started building contacts with renowned mathematicians in Western Europe and he established close friendships with Charles Hermite, Joseph Bertrand, Catalan, Leopold Kro necker, Edouard Lucas, and many others. Alexander Vasiliev [] and Vladimir Poss´e [] mention that he spent almost all his summers abroad, mainly in Paris. His Collected Works contain a report on a -month stay he made in France in , in which he records that he conversed with Ir´en´ee-Jules Bi enaym´e, Cauchy, Liouville, Hermite, Victor Am´ed´ee Lebesgue, Alphonse de Polignac, Joseph Alfred Serret, and other mathematicians. The meetings took place in the evening, since during the day he was busy visiting industrial plants. In his report, he notes his observations on the windmills in Lille, on the metallurgical plant in Hayange, on the paper mills in Coronne, on the foundry and the cannon factory in Ruelle, on a turbine in a windmill in Saint-Maur, on a water mill in Meaux, on an arms factory in Chatelleraut, etc. From Paris ˆ he made a small trip to London, where he conversed with Arthur Cayley and J. J. Sylvester, and visited the Royal Polytechnic Institute, where he examined models of various machines. He also went to Brussels, where he visited the museum of engines, and on his way back to Russia he made a stop in Berlin and had several discussions with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.
 Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev 
In , Chebyshev was elected adjunct at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. His first task was to assist V. Ya. Bunyakovsky, who noticed his strong capacity for work, in publish 
ing an edition of Euler’s works on num 
ber theory. He became an ordinary aca 
demician in . 
From childhood, Chebyshev was 
handicapped by a withered leg; he 
walked with the help of a stick and he 
was excluded from most of the children’s 
games. As we have noted, he was 
fascinated by mechanical devices, and 
kept this passion until the end of his 
life. One of his first constructions was a 
computing machine, which he built with

his own hands. His invented devices are displayed in the Conservatoire National des Arts et m´etiers in Paris, at Saint Pe tersburg University, the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, and elsewhere. 

Chebyshev was a member of most European Academies of Sciences. In , he was elected a foreign member (the first Russian after Peter the Great) of the Paris Acad´emie des Sciences. He became a member of the Association fran¸caise pour l’avancement des sciences, a learned society created in , aim ing to promote relations between the various sciences. Chebyshev participated in four of its annual meetings: Lyon (), Clermont-Ferrand (), Paris (), and La Rochelle (), each time presenting several works on various topics (geographical maps, the cutting of garments, his calculating machine, etc.). Abstracts of his talks are reproduced in his Collected Works. 
In , Chebyshev resigned from his professorship and started dedicating all his time to research. One day a week, his house was open to young scientists who wished to discuss their results with him or seek advice. In the summer of , he made his last extended visit to Paris. He died on November , . His tomb can be visited in the basement of the Church of the Transfiguration in the village of Spas-Prognanye,  km from the science city of Obninsk. In the nearby village of Mashkovo, there is a school named after Chebyshev, which hosts a museum containing a collection of original photographs and objects that belonged to him, including an arithmetic machine that he constructed. There are several biographies of Chebyshev, e.g., [, , ]. For a guide to his life and work, see []; on his contacts with Western European scientists, see [].

On Chebyshev’s work on geography 
Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev, like his most famous predecessor, Leonhard Euler, was involved in a great variety of research topics, including number theory, probability, the theory of elliptic integrals, differential geometry, ap proximation theory, mechanics, and others. He was always driven by the desire to find effective solutions with practical algorithms and good approx imations, in case a precise solution could not be found. His biographers report that while he spent a significant amount of his time studying the works of mathematicians from the past like Euler, Lagrange, Gauss and Abel, he avoided reading the works of his contemporaries, considering that this would be an obstacle to having original ideas. 
The mathematical theory of cartography, i.e., the art of map drawing, is an applied field that raises interesting theoretical questions in geometry and analysis, and it is not surprising that this topic became one of Chebyshev’s domains of interest. It was also an ideal ground for applying his ideas in approximation and interpolation theories. 
In , Chebyshev wrote two papers on cartography carrying the title Sur la construction des cartes g´eographiques, the same title as two memoirs that Lagrange published  years before []. It is probable that Chebyshev became interested in this field by reading Lagrange’s memoirs, but also those of Euler. Indeed, the latter was intensively involved in geography; at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences he had the official charge of geographer, and he published several works in cartography. The reader might refer to [] for a commented edition of the works of Euler and Lagrange on geography. Chebyshev was part of an editorial committee, headed by Bunyakovsky, for an edition of Euler’s works on number theory, and there is no doubt that he skimmed Euler’s works on various topics, including cartography. 
The problem of drawing geographical maps is that of mapping on a Eu clidean plane, and with minimal distorsion, a subset of a curved surface, which is usually a sphere representing the Earth. It was known by mathematicians since Greek antiquity that it is not possible to require that such a mapping preserves distances up to a scale. In other words, such a mapping has neces sarily a “distortion.” The main question was that of finding geographical maps whose distortion is minimal in a sense that had to be made precise. It is not surprising that Chebyshev, who was working on practical and theoretical prob-
