# Describe a Modern Article or Your Machine Learning Project

(inspired by [the assignment](https://github.com/sim0nsays/dlcourse_ai/blob/master/assignments/paper_post.md) from Semyon Kozlov's "DL on Fingers" course)

The field is developing very rapidly, so we constantly need to keep track or "get hands-on" with the latest achievements — let's practice doing this!
Almost all articles in the Machine Learning field are freely available online, usually on [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org).

## How to Find an Article Worth Reading?
There are many options!
- Follow links to scientific papers from news about the latest AI achievements, 
which are 
[very](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250210231820.htm) 
[very](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/01/jetbrains-junie-agent/)
[numerous](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-cosmos-world-foundation-model-platform-to-accelerate-physical-ai-development)

- Read in detail one of the articles mentioned in the course lectures (see links in the slides)
- Look at what is the latest achievement (State-of-The-Art) in a specific task. A good resource tracking SotA in a large class of tasks is [https://paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/). As examples, you can look at:
    - [Mask attention and transformer](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/masked-attention-mask-transformer-for)
    - [Semantic Segmentation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/semantic-segmentation)
    - [Question Answering](https://paperswithcode.com/task/question-answering)
    - [Distillation framework](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/a-fast-knowledge-distillation-framework-for)

- Search for articles with keywords that interest you through [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/)
- Follow links in communities related to Machine Learning
- Choose one of the articles that helped you in some competition

Finally, several examples of articles:
- [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) — where style transfer like Prisma began
- [Super-convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120) — an approach to very fast network training
- [SqueezeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360) — an example of architecture optimized for mobile devices
- [Mask RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) — development of RCNN for Instance Segmentation
- [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) — development of the basic CNN architecture after ResNet
- [Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07828) — using GANs to generate examples for training
- [OpenAI GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) — one of the most popular architectures for training language models
- [Transformer-XL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860) — development of the Transformer architecture
- [TacoTron2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884) — architecture for speech synthesis

## What Does "Describe" Mean?
Write a post with a brief description of the problem addressed in the article, the key idea and result, and post it somewhere! 
Blogposts on any site, public posts in Telegram chats, LinkedIn, videos on YouTube, etc. are acceptable.
Recommendations for the post:
- Describe the problem addressed in the article and the main metric. It would be great to provide examples of samples in the dataset, say how big it is, etc.
- Describe the key idea of the article "in simple terms," ideally in the context of past approaches or comparison with a baseline. Usually, articles have a diagram describing key points; include it and explain what it shows
- Describe the results. Often at the end of the article, there is a table comparing the approach from the article with other methods, which is also worth including and explaining
- Mention that the post was written for [Advanced ML course at NUP](https://avalur.github.io/advanced_ml.html)

Here are several posts of this type from the past courses:

## OK, and What Next?
Submit links to your posts to this assignment on the LMS page.
We will post the best ones on our social networks and, of course, 
organize a competition for the number of likes! :)
